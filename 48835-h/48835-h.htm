</div>

<p>Scarcely a week’s journey from London, with delicious
climates and any quantity of game, it always
seemed a marvel to me how few English sportsmen
ever found their way to the Crimea or Caucasus. It
is now something more than five years ago since I
first made myself acquainted with the breezy rosemary-clad
steppes of the former, or the low wooded
hills on the Black Sea coast of the latter. For
nearly three years resident at Kertch, I had ample
opportunity of testing all the pleasures of the
steppe, and a better shooting-ground for the wild-fowler
or man who likes a lot of hard work, with
a plentiful and varied bag at the end of his day,
could nowhere be found. Of course the sportsman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
in the Crimea must rough it to a certain extent,
but his roughing it, if he only has a civil tongue
and cheery manner, will be a good deal of the
‘beer and beefsteak’ order. The Russians are
hospitable to all men, especially to the sportsman;
and the peasants, even the Tartars, are cordial
good fellows if taken the right way.</p>

<p>On the steppes you need rarely want for a roof
overhead, if you prefer stuffiness, smoke, and domestic
insects to wild ones, with dew and the night
air. If you can put up with sour cream (very
good food when you are used to it), black bread,
an arboose, fresh or half-pickled, with a bumper
of fearful unsweetened gin (vodka) to digest the
foregoing, you need never suffer hunger long. But
for the most part sportsmen take their food with
them. Perhaps if my readers will let me, it would
be better to take them at once on to the steppe, and
tell them all this <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>Imagine then that for the last two days you
have been hard at work out of office hours loading
cartridges with every variety of shot, from the
small bullets used for the bustard down to the
dust-shot for the quail. Here, in Kertch, take a
victim’s advice: make your own cartridges, don’t
buy them. The month is July; the first of July,
with an intensely blue sky, far away above you,
giving you an idea of distance and immensity that
you could never conceive in England, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
clouds always look as if they would knock your
hat off. I should have said the sky will be blue
by-and-by, for at present it is too dark to see, and
we are carefully tucked away in bed; the impedimenta
of the coming journey&mdash;cold meats,
flasks of shooting powder, and jumping powder;
bread, guns, and a huge string of unsavoury
onions&mdash;all on the floor beside us. Ding, ding,
ding! as if the door-bell were in a fit, then a crash
and silence. No one ever rang a door-bell as a
Russian droshky-driver rings it. He likes the
muscular exertion, he loves the noise, and doesn’t
in the least mind being sworn at if, as in the
present instance, he breaks the bell-wire. A year
in Russia has hardened us to all this, so merely
speculating as to whether our landlord will pay
more for broken bell-wires this half than last, we
bundle out of bed and submit meekly to the reproaches
of our friends outside on the cart. They,
poor fellows, have had half an hour’s less sleep
than we have, and it’s only 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> now, so any
little hastiness of speech may be forgiven them.</p>

<p>But on such a morning as this, and on such a
conveyance as our droshky, no one could remain
sleepy or sulky long. The brisk bright air makes
the blood race through your veins, and the terrible
bumpings of the droshky on the uneven track, or half-paved
streets, keep you fully employed in striving
to avoid a spill or a fractured limb. Anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
more frightful to a novice in Russia than the
droshky I cannot conceive. This instrument of
torture is a combination of untrimmed logs and
ropes and wheels, with cruelly insinuating iron
bands, merciless knots, and ubiquitous splinters.
Manage your seat how you will, you are bound to
keep bumping up and down, and at each descent
you land on something more painful than that you
have encountered before.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, as the droshky leaves the town,
the old German jäger breaks out into a hunting
ditty, and, truth to tell, until the wind is fairly
jogged out of us we are a very noisy party. Then
we try to light our cigarettes and pipes, and if we
are lucky, only have the hot ashes jerked on to our
next neighbour’s knee. Gradually the dawning
light increases, the clouds of pearly grey are
reddening, and the long undulating swell of the
steppeland slowly unfolds itself around us. On
our left are the Straits of Kertch, the sea looking
still and hazy, with some half-dozen English
steamers lording it amongst the mosquito fleet of
fruiterers and lighters which fills the bay. All
round us are chains of those small hills, whose
dome-like tops proclaim them tumuli of kings and
chiefs who went to rest ages ago, when the town
behind us was still a mighty city, rejoicing in the
name of Panticapæum.</p>

<p>Once clear of the ranges of tumuli or kourgans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
as they call them here, there is nothing but
steppe. On all points, except the seaside of the
view, a treeless prairie; no hills, no houses, scarcely
even a bush to break the monotony of bare or
weed-grown waste. On the right of the post-road
by which we are travelling (a mere beaten track
and really no road at all) run the lines of the
Indo-European Telegraph Company, their neat
slim posts of iron contrasting not unfavourably
with the crooked, misshapen posts which support
the Russian lines on our left. Unimportant as
these might appear elsewhere, they are important
objects here, where they are the only landmarks
to man, and the only substitute for trees to the
fowl of the air.</p>

<p>All along the road on either side of us the
wires are now becoming lined with kestrels, just
up evidently, and looking as though they were
giving themselves a shake, and rubbing their eyes
preparatory to a day’s sport amongst the beetles
and field-mice that swarm on the steppe. The
number of kestrels round Kertch is something
astonishing, and I almost think that with the other
hawks, the blue hen harrier, kites and crows, they
would almost outnumber the sparrows of the town.
Now, too, our lovely summer visitants, the golden-throated
bee-eaters, begin to shoot and poise
swallow-like over the heads of the tall yellow
hollyhock growing in wild profusion over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
plain; hoopoes, with broad crests erect, peck and
strut bantam-like by the roadside, while every now
and again the magnificent azure wings of the ‘roller’
glitter in the morning sun among the flowers.</p>

<p>The ‘bleak steppeland’ is what you always
hear of, and shudder as you hear, dread Siberian
visions being conjured up at the mere name. But
who that has seen the steppes in the later days of
spring, or in the glow of midsummer, would apply
such an epithet to lands that in their season are as
richly clad in flowers as any prairie of the West?
Long strips of wild tulip, Nature’s cloth of gold,
blue cornflower, crow’s-foot and bird’s-eye, the
canary-coloured hollyhock and crimson wild pea,
all vie in compensating the steppeland for her
chill snow-shroud in the months that are gone and
to come.</p>

<p>Rich as the land is, the crops by the roadside
are few and paltry, the chief being rye, maize,
millet, and sunflowers. The sunflowers are cultivated
for their seed, which is either used for
making oil, or more generally is sold in a dry
state as ‘cernitchkies.’ ‘Cernitchkies’ furnish the
Malo Russ, male and female, with one of their
most favourite means of wasting time. Go where
you will, at any time, in Kertch, you will find
people cracking these sunflower seeds, and trying
to make two bites of the kernel. At every street
corner you find a stall where they are sold, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
you rarely come in without finding one of the
little grey shards clinging to your dress, spat upon
you by some careless passer-by, or sent adrift from
some balcony overhead.</p>

<p>Beside these crops, you come across long strips
of water melons, the principal food of the Malo
Russ in the summer, and one of the chief sources
of the Asiatic cholera sometimes so prevalent here.
But for the most part the land is untilled&mdash;left to
its wild-flowers and weeds.</p>

<p>The peasant of the Crimea makes but a sorry
agriculturist. The Malo Russ is a lazy, good-natured
ne’er-do-weel; his days being more than
half ‘prasniks’ (saints’ days), he devotes the
holy half to getting drunk on vodka, the other half
to recovering from the effects of the day before.
One day you may see him in long boots and a
red shirt, with his arms round another big-bearded
moujik’s neck in the drinking den, or husband and
wife, on the broad of their backs, dead drunk, on
the highway. The day after you’ll find him in a
moralizing mood, seated on his doorstep, smoking
the eternal papiros, or nibbling sunflower seeds.</p>

<p>Russians have told me that there are more
holy days than calendar days in the year. To be
holy a day need not be a saint’s day&mdash;a birthday
in the Emperor’s family is quite enough to make
a ‘prasnik.’ Of the actual Church fêtes there
are 128.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The best agriculturists here are the German
colonists, whose neat homesteads remind one for
the moment of lands nearer home. Even the
Tartars are better than the Malo Russ, but they
have lately been leaving the Crimea in large
numbers to escape the compulsory military service
which Russia seeks to impose upon them. Everywhere
the army seems to be the worst enemy of
the State.</p>

<p>At last our ride comes to an end, and there is
a general stretching of limbs and buckling on of
shot-belts and powder-flasks, for with many muzzle-loaders
are still the fashion here. The place at which
we have stopped is the ‘Starrie Metchat,’ or old
church, a Tartar ruin near a well, embosomed in
rosemary-covered hills. Near this well we pitch our
tents, and then we each go off on a beat of our own.
Here there is room enough for all, and as some
excellent Russian sportsmen have a careless way
of shooting through their friends’ legs at a bolting
hare, perhaps solitude has its peculiar advantages.</p>

<p>As you breast the first hill the sweet-scented
covert comes nearly up to your waist, and right
and left of you huge grasshoppers jump away or
into your face with a vicious snap that is at first
enough to upset the best regulated nerves. But
see, your dog is pointing, and as you near him a
large covey of grey birds, larger than our grouse,
get up with whistling wings, and with smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
undulating flight skim round the corner of the
next hill. You get one long shot and bag your
bird perhaps. The dog moves uncertainly forward,
and then stands again. Go up to him; wherever
strepita (lesser bustard) have been you are sure to
find a hare or two close by. Time after time have
I found this, although I cannot account for the
fact in any way. The hares here are larger than
our English hares, and in winter turn almost
white, the skins in autumn having sometimes
most beautiful shades of silver and rose upon
them. The largest hare I ever remember to have
seen weighed nearly thirteen pounds&mdash;it was an
old buck&mdash;while in England a hare of eight
pounds is exceptionally large.</p>

<p>The dogs used in the Crimea for coursing are
called Tscherkess greyhounds; they stand considerably
higher at the shoulder than our own
dogs, are broken-haired, with a much longer coat
than our staghound, and a feathered stern. I am
told that on the flat the English greyhound beats
them for a short distance; but that in the hills,
or with a strong old hare well on her legs before
them, the Crimean dogs have it all their own
way. I never had the good fortune to see the
two breeds tried together. In fact, what coursing
I did see was utterly spoilt by the Russian
habit of cutting off the hare, and shooting her
under the dog’s nose. This is, of course, utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
alien to our notions of sport&mdash;but so are most of
their sporting habits. They never shoot flying
if they can get a chance sitting. Bears and boars
and such large game they shoot from platforms in
trees at night; and I never saw a horse jump in
all my three years in Southern Russia. Of course,
what applies to the Crimea and the Caucasus may
not apply to other parts of Russia.</p>

<p>As long as we keep in the rosemary, hares,
quails, and strepita are all we are likely to meet
with, except that in the valley and on the less
sunny hillsides the dogs ever and anon flush
large owls, that sail away hardly as bewildered as
they are generally supposed to be by the sunlight.
Overhead kites and harriers swim about in the
clear sky, keeping a keen look-out for winged
quails or wounded hares. But as we get to the
top of the next rising ground we see in the plain
far away at our feet a long line of what might well
be grey-coated infantry. A closer inspection, or a
previous acquaintance with the objects before us, will
enable us to make them out to be bustards feeding
line upon line in a flock&mdash;or herd, to speak correctly&mdash;of
several hundreds. Most of them are busy with
their heads on the ground, gleaning what they can
from an old maize field; but here and there, at a
slight distance from the rest, stands a sentry that
the most wary stalker cannot baffle, or the most
alluring grain tempt from his ceaseless watch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Knowing that we are already seen, and being
perfectly well aware that by ordinary stalking on
these open plains we could never get nearer than
three hundred yards from the herd before the old
sentinel sets them all in motion with his shrill call,
we retrace our steps, and get our comrades together.
Then the horses are put to, and all with our guns
in readiness we drive towards the point at which
the bustards were seen. When within sight of
them we make arrangements among ourselves, and
then the droshky is driven quietly past the bustards
some five hundred yards from them. All their
heads are up, and the whole of the herd of two
hundred is watching us intently; but they know
something of the range of a gun, and feel safe
enough to stay yet awhile. Watch hard as you
may, grey birds, you didn’t notice that one of the
occupants of the droshky has just rolled off, gun in
hand, and is now lying flat buried in a deliciously
fragrant bed of rosemary. One by one, as the
droshky circles round the watchful birds, the occupants
drop off and lie still, until at last we have a
cordon of sportsmen drawn right round the herd,
and only the yemstchik remains on the droshky.
Slowly, so as not to frighten them, he narrows his
circle, while each hidden gunner keeps his eye
anxiously on his movements.</p>

<p>At last, having stretched their necks to the very
utmost limit and twisted them into gyrations that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
would surprise a corkscrew, the bustards think they
have had enough of it, and there is a slow flapping
of wings, and hoisting of the heavy bodies into air.
Slowly, with a grand solemn flight, wonderfully in
keeping with the wild majesty of the boundless
plains on which they live, they sail away towards
the hills. Suddenly the leaders stop with a jerk,
and try too late to change their direction. From
the covert beneath the sportsman starts to his
feet, two bright flashes are seen, two reports follow,
one huge bird collapses at once and another lowers
for a moment, and then goes feebly on to fall at the
first discharge of the next hidden gun. Right and
left the remainder fly, rising somewhat as they do
so, but still not high enough to take them out of
danger, and when at last they have passed the fatal
circle, five fine birds reward our stratagem.</p>

<p>One of us has to face a storm of chaff hard for
a disappointed sportsman to bear, for in his excitement
he had neglected to change his cartridges; and
although standing within short pistol-shot of a
passing monster, the quail-shot produces nothing
more than a shower of feathers, enough almost to
stuff a bolster with.</p>

<p>By thus surrounding them, and by shooting
them occasionally from a cart, a few of these magnificent
birds (larger than a turkey and finer eating)
are killed from time to time throughout summer
and autumn. A few too are sometimes picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
up by the gunner in the early summer whilst still
young, as they hide separately or in small coveys in
the deep undergrowth. But the only time when any
quantity are exposed in the bazaar for sale is in the
depths of winter. Then when a snowstorm has
caught the birds hiding in the valleys, and clogged
their wings with snow, which a bitter wind still
more surely binds about them, these poor denizens
of the desert are surrounded and driven like a flock
of sheep into the Tartar villages, where they are
butchered, and thence sent in cartloads into Kertch,
to be sold at a rouble and a half (3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) apiece.</p>

<p>After slaying the bustards, having done enough
for glory, we have time to remember a thirst that
would empty a samovar and an appetite that would
astonish a negro. Gladly we hurry back to our
little tent in a cleft at the foot of the hills, and
while one unpacks the cold meats, dried sturgeon
and caviare, another gets water for that tea without
which our repast would be poor indeed to a Russian.
Being born and bred Englishmen, two of us
might well have been expected to prefer our native
beer to tea, but it is wonderful how fond men get
of the delicious tea brewed in Russia, with its slip of
lemon in it to add piquancy to the flavour. For
my own part, after really severe exertion I am most
thoroughly convinced it is by far the best restorative
you can take, and one which I should prefer to
any other liquid whatever. Try as you will you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
can neither get nor make such tea in England, and
once away from Russia, you must be content to leave
the blessings of tea, ‘swejie ikra’ (fresh caviare),
and the soothing papiros (cigarette) behind you;
for numerous as tobacconists are in England, I
know none where really good cigarette tobacco can
be bought, such as you smoke in the Crimea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as we are still here, let us lie on our
backs and enjoy the delicious weed, watching the
yemstchik arrange that wonderful puzzle of old
cord which constitutes the harness of a troika. At
last the horses are ready, and depositing ourselves
and game on the jolting vehicle, we let our legs
swing over the side, and if used to the motion
manage to get a great deal of pleasure out of the
drive home.</p>

<p>As the evening closes in over these wild waste
lands, a stillness and peace seem to come with it
of which one has no knowledge in the towns. The
piping of the quails, the long soft wail of the
coolik (curlew), and even the notes of the German
hunting horn on the other droshky far in front, all
seem to make fitting music for the hour and scene;
and as the stars begin to shine out from a sky of
infinite depth and metallic blueness, the oojai
domoi (home already) is spoken not without an
accent of regret, though limbs are tired and steppe
roads rough.</p>

<p>It was in February of 1876 that I first made
acquaintance with the Caucasus. Once or twice
before then it is true that I had crossed over to
Taman and had a day’s pheasant-shooting on the
reedy shores of the Kuban. As we poled our flat-bottomed
boat along its sluggish waters, I had a
glimpse every now and again of the track of boar
or cazeole (roe), that made me long for a chance of
a longer stay on its banks. But it was not until
the February of 1876 that my wish was granted.
For weeks we had had all business stopped by the
frost. The whole of the Azov was frozen as hard
as the high-road, and it was only beyond the forts
and well into the Black Sea that any open water
could be found. Here the wild-fowl swarmed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Along the edge of the ice, where the open water
began, lines of cormorants stood solemn and patient,
fringing the ice with a black border of upright
forms for miles. Beyond these in the open water
were myriads of crested duck (anas fuligula),
golden-eye pochards, scaups, and whistlers. Here
and there in bevies, with hoods extended, the great
grebes sailed about, while great northern divers and
rosy-breasted mergansers all added their quota to
the beauty of the scene. More beautiful than all
others, groups of smews, with their plumage of
delicately pencilled snow, ducked and curtsied on
the swelling wave, while overhead the pintail
whistled by, the large fish-hawks poised in air, and
the gulls laughed and chattered perpetually.</p>

<p>For the last few weeks most of my time had
been spent among the wild-fowl or skating with
the fair ladies of Kertch on the rink by the jetty.
But one fine morning the lines of the Indo-European
Telegraph Company between Taman and
Ekaterinodar were good enough to break down, and
my friend the chief of the Kertch station was
ordered to make an inspection of them along their
whole length from one point to another. It seemed
to him a long and wearisome journey to make by
himself, so that like a good man and considerate,
he asked me to share his sledge with him. Always
glad to give me a chance of enjoying myself in my
own way, my kind old chief readily agreed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
arrangement, and within an hour from the time
when K. first proposed the trip, he and I were hard
at work in the bazaar purchasing stores for the
journey. There is of course a post-road from
Taman to Ekaterinodar, but badly indeed will those
fare who trust to the resources of a Russian post
station for their bodily comfort. This we well
knew, and in consequence a large stock of German
sausages, caviare, vodka, and other portable eatables
and drinkables were stowed away in the body of
our sledge.</p>

<p>For many days previous to the time of which
I write, the over-sea route from Yenikale to
Taman had been open to carts and sledges, while
vans, laden with corn, had been continually crossing
with only an aggregate of two accidents in the
last four days. It was then with but few misgivings
that we embarked in our sledge with a
really good ‘troika’ (team of three) in front,
coached by the noisiest rascal of a yemstchik that
ever swore at horses. Our road for the first
twenty-two versts lay over the bosom of the Azov,
and as we passed through regular streets of mosquito
shipping, and now and then under the hull
of some big steamer caught in the ice, the sensation
was strangely novel. For the first ten versts
the road was good, the pace exhilarating, and buried
in our warm rugs we hugged to ourselves the conviction
that we were in for a really good thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
After this, however, we got to piled and broken
ice, where the accidents of the last four days had
occurred, and where our driver averred a current
existed. Here my friend got nervous, and insisted
on walking at a fair distance from the sledge, which
proceeded meanwhile at a foot’s pace. This in the
increasing frost mist was not so cheerful, but the
current was soon cleared, and in another half hour
we landed safe and sound at that miserable little
town of Taman.</p>

<p>The only living things we had passed on our
way were several wretched assemblies of pale-looking
gulls, literally frozen out, poor fellows, and a
few huge eagles, squatting on the ice, their plumes
all ruffled up, suffering probably as much from a
surfeit of wounded ducks as from cold. The whole
scene as we crossed was as desolate as the mind can
well imagine; Kertch behind us, white with snow,
clustering round the hill of Mithridates, a mere
skeleton of her former glory in the days of Greek
and Persian; Taman, once too a prosperous city,
now a few hovels buried in a snowdrift; Yenikale
perhaps more dead than either; and all round the
long low hills, the rounded tumuli of dead kings;
the tall bare masts of the belated ships; a frozen
sea beneath and a freezing sky above.</p>

<p>Once in Taman we gave our driver a good tip
(‘na tchai’) for the tea as they call it, and betook
ourselves to a friend’s house for a few minutes’ rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
before our next start. Why a yemstchik’s fee, which
is invariably spent in nips of vodka (unsweetened
gin) should be called tea-money, has always appeared
to me an unanswerable enigma. Taman
hardly deserves a description, even from so humble
a pen as mine. It has a jetty and a telegraph
station; is the post from which a few cattle are
shipped to Kertch, and to which a few travellers to
the Caucasus come from the same place. Once it
was a large and flourishing city, twin sister to
Panticapæum (Kertch) on the other side of the
straits; now it is a collection of miserable hovels,
surrounded by mud knee-deep in winter and storms
of dust in summer, with an odour of fish and the
vodka shop in all seasons. There are near to
Taman some large oil-works, from which naphtha
is said to be extracted in large quantities. It may
be so, but I hear that their original owner is bankrupt,
and he was a Russian; so that as the present
proprietors are Americans, and as such less likely
to be able to protect themselves from local frauds, I
should not feel inclined to invest my bottom dollar
in the Taman Oil Company.</p>

<p>Such a wretched place did we find Taman, that
we were glad to leave it and commence our journey
inland at once. In describing a journey the
traveller as a rule looks to the scenery to supply at
least a very large portion of his description; what
then shall the luckless traveller do, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
literally no scenery to describe? The road is a
beaten track by the telegraph posts, with, every
sixteen or twenty versts, a white house with a straw
yard and some sheds at the back, and a black and
white post with a bell roofed in on the top of
it in the front. This is the post station. The
country surrounding it is apparently waste, and,
except for a few flocks of sheep, an old hooded
crow or two, and maybe a bustard, quite untenanted
by living things. Always the snow
beneath and the jingling bells in front, and this
with no incident to rouse one, naturally ends in sleep.</p>

<p>Towards evening we came in sight of a larger
group of buildings than any we had hitherto seen,
and this we found was Tumerūk, our resting-place
for the night. As far as we could see it was a
larger town than Taman, with the inevitable green-domed
church, a good spacious bazaar, barracks I
think, and a neat little club-house. We were told
that Tumerūk derived its wealth from the sturgeon
fishery carried on to a very great extent in its
neighbourhood. We were also told there were two
good hotels in the place, and set off in high spirits
to search for them, a comfortable bed to follow a
good supper of sturgeon and caviare being things as
welcome as they were unexpected. We searched
diligently and found the first hotel, a moujik’s
drinking den or ‘cabak.’ There was a table with
a man under it, and many more nearly ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
follow his peaceful example, but no beds and no
supper. At last we found the grand hotel, a gaunt
white house near the bazaar. With doubting
hearts (for the place looked deserted) we beat at
the little door, but got no response. After nearly
ten minutes spent in mutilating our knuckles and
damaging the door, a fellow in shirt and slippers
turned up, looking as astonished as his besotted
face would allow him to. The ‘cazain’ (master)
was away, he said, and spite of his boasting anent
the capabilities of his house, we soon found there
was no food in it but black bread&mdash;no servant but
himself. But he managed to find us a room in
fair repair, with a couple of the usual wooden bedsteads
in it, and this we took. To our horror we
found the stoves had not been lighted for a month,
and were out of order, so that the cold indoors was
greater than that without. Still it was too late to
seek a lodging elsewhere, so we had some of our
own stores cooked, a dram of Tumerūk vodka
from the cabak, a small charcoal stove put in the
middle of the room, and then rolling ourselves in
every fragment of clothing we could find, and
almost regretting that we had ever left our comfortable
quarters in Kertch, we proceeded to reap
the reward of our long drive in a deep and dreamless
sleep.</p>

<p>Towards morning I half awoke with an idea that
the house was attacked, so violent was the noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
that aroused me, and at once jumped up to see what
was happening. But the moment I was out of
bed a strange giddiness seized me, and turning
round I fell, and remember no more until I found
a friendly telegraphist endeavouring to rouse me
with libations of cold water freely applied. Gradually
I came round, but with such an intense
headache and utter inability to use my own limbs,
that I had rather have remained insensible. I was
utterly unable to help in rousing my poor friend
K., and as my senses came back to me I became
seriously alarmed lest our morning callers should
have been too late to save him.</p>

<p>The truth was, something was wrong with the
charcoal stove. Every aperture through which
ventilation could be effected had, Russian fashion,
been hermetically sealed for the winter, and my
friend and I had had the narrowest escape from
asphyxiation possible. After immense efforts we
brought him round, but in spite of the bracing
cold and the rapid driving, we both suffered from
racking headaches and extreme lassitude for the
rest of the day.</p>

<p>The travelling during this second day was of a
more interesting nature; the country being covered
in many places for miles with jungles of a tall
reed called ‘kamish,’ in which pheasants are said
to abound, and boars and roe to occur not infrequently.
After getting out of the reedy land we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
came to a tract of another nature, bare and rock-strewn;
and here, within half a mile of the station
at which we slept, I was surprised to see numbers
of foxes hunting about in the snow for food. I
should think that at one time a score must have been
in sight simultaneously. As soon as we had taken
in our rugs and ordered the samovar, I took my
rifle, as it was not yet dusk, and tried to stalk
one of these little red rovers, without the least
compunction, as foxhounds are probably a blessing
of civilisation with which these barren lands will
never be acquainted. But though I stalked a good
deal and shot once or twice, I did no good until I
got to a frozen lake, some three-quarters of a mile
from the station. Here I wounded a fox and followed
him for some distance over the ice, and in
doing so came across the remains of some large
animal lately torn to pieces by brutes of prey.</p>

<p>Having given up my fox, I was meditating
what manner of beasts these might be, when my
answer came in a long, weird howl. No need to
tell any one what that sound is. Instinct teaches
every man to recognise the wolf’s howl, and once
heard it is not easily forgotten. The first howl
was followed by another and another, and though
I have no wish to pose as a coward, I frankly
admit I wished I was anywhere but three-quarters
of a mile from a house, and all the distance two
feet deep in snow, which would not bear my weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
on the surface. The wind, luckily, was from them
to me, so that, though I walked back at my best
pace, plunging frantically into deep drifts every
few yards, from which I was spurred on by ever-recurring
wolf music, I saw nothing, though I
heard a good deal of my grim serenaders. It was
a retreat, I admit, undignified, if you will; but if
the wind had been in another quarter it might
have been worse. Over our tea that night the
station-master spun many a long yarn of the doings
of the wolves, highly coloured perhaps, but true in
part, I believe. Next morning their tracks were
numerous by the post-road, and they must evidently
have been about in some force.</p>

<p>After another day’s journey, passing through a
few Cossack villages, with their green-domed
churches and walled enclosures, we at last came
in sight of our journey’s end, Ekaterinodar. This
is the first town of any size on this side the Caucasus,
and at first sight even this is more forest
than town. The trees have just been sufficiently
removed to make room for the houses, but wherever
no house actually stands the forest has not
been interfered with. The effect was extremely
pretty, now that the snow had loaded every tree
with its white plumes and given the streets a hard
white covering; but in summer, when the acacias
(which predominate here) are in blossom, Ekaterinodar
must be as lovely as it is malarious. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
summer and early autumn fever rages here, and
even now every man and woman that we pass in
the streets has a yellow wizen face that tells of
the ravages of this Asiatic curse. Here at last
everything is genuinely Asiatic except the buildings.
The grotesque combinations of top hat and
long boots are not seen here. The denizens of the
streets are tall Cossacks with high sheepskin hats,
with a crown all scarlet cloth and gold braid;
short broad-shouldered Tartars, in loose blue garments,
belted at the waist with bright-coloured
shawls; women in short petticoats and high boots
with bashliks over their heads. The shops are
most of them open magazines, with no glass front,
but instead an awning in front of them, and inside
a broad counter, on which the proprietor sits
cross-legged with cigarette or long pipe in mouth.
The wares for sale consist chiefly of pelts brought
in by the Tscherkesses from the neighbourhood; and
here, in the examination of them, my friend and I
spent no small time, as a great deal of the natural
history of the country may be gleaned from these
middlemen, and many a good guide and hunter
be secured from among their clients.</p>

<p>I shall pass over the two days we spent here
as shortly as possible. My friend had his work
to do, and my own time was filled up by chatting
with the officers who frequented the hotel at
which we were staying. It was whilst thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
engaged that we first heard of the existence of a
large royal forest of some twenty-nine square
versts in extent, which lay only some fifteen versts
out of our course on the return journey. To
make up our minds to visit it, having secured
letters of introduction to the royal forester (Col.
R.), was the work of five minutes, and next
morning saw us with a friend in our sledge, who
knew the colonel, dashing with buoyant spirits
over the glittering snow. When the long line of
darkly-wooded country first caught our eyes clean
cut against the frosty blue sky, the stars were
already in the heavens, and an occasional bark
told us the foxes were all abroad, busy in their
nocturnal forays.</p>

<p>After a drive of half-an-hour through dim
forest rides, a fire glimmered ruddily through the
trees, and the deep baying of hounds told us we
had almost arrived. The forester’s house was a
small four-roomed cottage, with a wattle enclosure
round it, while outside the enclosure a few huts
and a huge bonfire betokened the presence of the
score of Cossacks who formed his staff. Throwing
open his door, our host rushed out to meet us, a
little wiry man, with a ruddy complexion, bright
merry eye, huge grizzled moustache, and the most
cordial manners possible. Once inside the cottage,
the samovar was soon steaming comfortably, and a
supper of caviare and roebuck broth, with the meat to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
follow, was discussed with an appetite which even the
schnapps could not increase. Then bed was proposed,
and my friend being a German, and of a
certain age, readily fell in with the proposition. Not
so the writer. To sit still or go to bed, now
when all the longings of one’s life were almost
granted, hearing the veteran sportsman before me
discoursing calmly of the boars that had broken
into his enclosure the night before, or the stag
which he had shot a few nights before that, was too
much for my boyish impatience; and my kind
old host, seeing it, was as pleased at my keenness
as amused at my impatience. Going out, he found
one of the Cossacks was just preparing for a night
hunt, and returning asked me if I would care to
accompany him. Of course I jumped at the offer,
and was starting forthwith. But my host called
me back, and making me leave my own useless
garments behind me, dressed me in a huge pair
of felt boots of his own and his fur-lined, much-braided
forester’s coat. Thus attired, I must have
been too much of an attraction for my lazy friend,
who shook himself together, and being similarly
clad resolved to follow me.</p>

<p>The Cossack who was to be our chaperone was
a sturdy, ill-favoured fellow, in the wildest combination
of sheepskins conceivable, but he seemed
to know his work, and was none the worse for
being silent. As we passed down the long forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
aisles, our footsteps, thanks to the felt shoes and
the snow, were soundless even in that still night.
Half an hour’s tramp through a perfect fairy land
of frozen oaks, with a carpet of snow at their feet,
on which our guide silently pointed out many a
fresh track, and then we paused. One of us was
to stay here; I stayed, my friend took a position
a quarter of a mile further on, the Cossack being
at the same distance beyond him. My own post was
at the foot of an enormous oak, and here I crouched,
my long felt boots deep sunk in the snow, my
back against the tree, and my rifle across my knees.</p>

<p>Now it was that I learnt how necessary it is to
wear the clothing of the country. Sitting thus
with my feet in the snow in tight leather boots, I
must have either kept up the circulation by moving
my feet occasionally, which would have been fatal
to my chance of sport, or I must have had my
feet frost-bitten. As it was, in my loose boots of
felt, my feet were almost too hot, and of course
the rest of my body kept about the same temperature
as my feet.</p>

<p>Once my companions had taken up their posts
the whole forest was still as death for some
minutes. The stillness indeed was so great as
to be oppressive, and the occasional sounds&mdash;an
owl’s weird hoot, the howl of a wolf, or the
stealthy spring of an old grey hare&mdash;only heightened
the effect by contrast. On every side I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
look down long vistas of frozen hazels with tall
oaks rising above them, through whose quaintly
twisting limbs the intense metallic light of the
winter moon gleamed down on the sparkling snow,
or catching the icicles that hung in huge clusters
from them drew from them all manner of pale
prismatic colours. Every now and again a dark shadow
glided over the snow, and a sound like a devil’s
low chuckling laugh told one that the substance
of that shadow was the great eagle owl, whose
strong silent pinions were creeping, a very shadow
of death, over some doomed hare. At one time a
company of wolves seemed to have gathered round,
for as soon as a long vibrating howl had moaned
itself into silence on one side, another took up the
strain and startled the forest on the other. All
round us this music was kept up, but not a single
wolf showed himself either to my companions or
myself. Suddenly there was a loud report as if
an enormous piece of artillery had been fired, and
as the echoes thundered through the forest, the
whole seemed to wake at once to a fiendish riot of
strange sound. Every prowling beast and weird
night-bird screamed in concert, and then all was
silence again. This was caused by the cracking
of the ice on the Kuban some miles off.</p>

<p>After an hour of intense enjoyment of this
kind, I was roused by a distant crashing, as though
a regiment was noisily breaking its way through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the undergrowth. On and on it came, growing
ever louder as it drew near, until the noise in that
silent place seemed worthy of a herd of elephants.
It came straight towards where I lay, and my
heart beat so loudly with excitement that I really
believed for the moment that the approaching
beasts must hear it as I did; and in my anxiety I
even pressed my breast with my hands in an unreasoning
hope of silencing it. The noise was now
so close that it seemed impossible but that I must
see the cause of it, when suddenly another sound
caught my ear. A slow scraping sound, painfully
distinct for a minute, while the other sound ceased;
then a rasping sound and a crash as of some heavy
body falling, followed by a thundering rush, a
glimpse of four splendid deer, magnified by the
moonlight, bounding across one of the hazel vistas
some four hundred yards off, a sharp, clear whistle,
and then as the sound of the flying deer died away,
the tramp of approaching footsteps, and all was
over. The Cossack arrived first, and behind him
my German jäger, woefully crestfallen, as well he
might have been could he have known what black
wrath filled his companion’s heart. The deer had
been coming straight to me when my friend,
alarmed by the tremendous noise they made
amongst the frozen branches, had attempted to
swarm the oak under which he had been placed.
For a time he got on very well, and then losing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
his hold on the slippery trunk, he came down on
his back with a crash that unluckily frightened our
game more than it hurt him.</p>

<p>So ended our first night’s sport; but though
we bagged nothing, no real sportsman I think
would allow that a night spent amid such glorious
surroundings, listening to the voices of Nature in
one of her wildest moods, was a night wasted. At
any rate when we got home my rest was the
sweeter for my toil.</p>

<p>The day following this eventful night was spent
in preparations for the grand drive fixed for the
morrow; but though there was much to be done,
our kind host arranged to give us some shooting
in the afternoon of this day also. Lunch over,
we took the hounds out&mdash;dark brown dogs with
tan chests and points, looking as if they had a
large cross of the bloodhound. The <i>modus operandi</i>
of the day’s sport was simple in the extreme.
The whole forest was divided into sections, each containing
one square verst. Round one of these the
guns were placed, and then the forester and his
dogs went into the thick of it, and in a few minutes
the woods were full of deep-toned music. The
dogs seemed to me to hunt everything they came
across, from a stag to a running cock pheasant,
and the business of the gunner was to kill and, if
possible, to bag the game before the dogs did.
There was a great deal of excitement, men shouting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
dogs baying, guns firing, and hares scuttling
to the right and left of you, while through all,
with a beautiful pertinacity which hardly allowed
him time to fire a shot, the veteran forester tootled
away on his horn. This would have augured
badly for our sport on the morrow but that the
forest was immense, and we were only in an outlying
bit of it, from which we probably drove some
game towards our next day’s ground. Although
the snow was covered with tracks, we saw nothing
but hares, of which we bagged about twenty.</p>

<p>The morning of Thursday broke as brilliantly
as its predecessors, and the sun seemed if possible
to glare with a harder light on the frozen snow.
Outside our door the forester was apparently on
the point of knocking down three or four Cossacks
almost as excited as himself. His voice rose to a
scream, his arms kept swinging about; even I
knew enough Russian to hear that he was swearing
awfully, and I had my fears lest something
had happened to mar our day’s sport. However, he
finally calmed down, and presently I heard him calling
a huge-bearded ruffian a little dove (golubchik),
whom he had addressed as the son of the most
immoral of the canine race not five minutes before.
He was merely explaining some of the minor details
in the business of the coming day, he told me
afterwards.</p>

<p>About 7.30 a Cossack colonel, with a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of his men, turned up. This was the local Nimrod,
and these the beaters he brought with him; and
a wilder lot to look at, a more thirsty lot to refresh,
a noisier, more frolicsome lot altogether, you
could not find even at Donnybrook fair. With
the colonel came another Russian and a couple of
young Frenchmen, and this made up our party.</p>

<p>A huge sledge was in attendance for the sportsmen,
and another for the game. The beaters were
sent on, and some of the more reliable entrusted
with a third sledge laden with eatables and a cask
of goodly dimensions. As the last Cossack disappeared
down the forest drive, we turned back
into the cottage, lighted our cigarettes, and having
collected our ammunition, took our places on the
sledge waiting for us, and drove merrily to the
meet. On our way the overhanging branches
caught us now and again, sweeping one of our
number into the snow, amid peals of laughter from
all but the victim.</p>

<p>Arrived at the rendezvous, strict silence was
enjoined, the guns were posted, each a hundred
yards or so from the other, along one side of the
division, with orders on no account to leave those
posts until told to do so. Meanwhile the Cossack
colonel had taken his hundred men to the opposite
side of the section, and all being in readiness, we
heard his horn signal ‘forward,’ and then all was
silent as the grave. Every eye was strained on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the bushes and thick covert in front, every ear
intently listening for the patter of feet or the sound
of breaking brushwood. But as yet no sound:
even the Cossacks were too distant to be heard
as yet. Did some one move along the line? No,
every soul is still as we are. Again the crash;
the sound that set our hearts beating a few nights
ago, but now far less startling in the daylight than
it was then in the shadows and stillness of night.</p>

<p>Here they come trooping towards our line, four
does and a tall stag in front, half trotting, half
walking, tossing their dainty heads up and down
as they approach. They advance straight towards
the oak at which I saw my German friend
posted, and I reluctantly hold my hand that he
may make the best of his chance. Nearer and
nearer they come, and yet no shot breaks the stillness,
though they are almost past him. Suddenly
they throw up their heads, and with a rush are
lost in the forest beyond, without a shot having
been fired at them. My friend had of course
broken the rules, left his own tree, and gone off to
one which seemed to him to have greater attractions.
Thus the deer had for the second time
passed him unfired at.</p>

<p>Soon the shots began to ring out, at first only
a dropping fire, though towards the end of the
drive the firing was so frequent as almost to
resemble file-firing. After the red deer a wild cat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
came towards me, moving softly over the snow;
and as my eye followed him I became aware of
some dozen grey forms that had risen suddenly
ghost-like all round me: one old hare sitting absolutely
under my tree and gazing apparently rigidly
into my face. There she sat, listening to the shots,
without stirring for some five minutes, until in the
open between two great oaks a fine red fox came
trotting stealthily towards us, his broad heavy
brush spread, and seeming to trail on the snow
behind him, which threw his whole graceful, undulating
form out in bold relief. It seemed against
one’s English nature to shoot him, but it had to
be done, and a charge of heavy shot rolled him
over on the snow. It seemed like shooting a
friend.</p>

<p>By this time the cries of the beaters had drawn
very near, some of their forms even showing from
time to time in open places. Three quick springs
and an abrupt pause in the bushes in front of me
now arrested my attention, but thinking after a
time that it was only another hare, I singled out
one of these long-eared gentry, and rolled him
over. As I did so two roebucks broke covert, and
galloped rapidly past our Russian friend on the
left, who, making a neat right and left, laid them
both on the path.</p>

<p>This was the shot of the day. A bugle now
sounded a warning to turn our backs to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
beaters and only shoot as the game passed us, thus
avoiding the chance of bagging a beater. The
hares came thick and fast, and as they cantered
steadily away, a large number of them were
bagged. When we came out on to the path there
were four roes, a red deer, of which I had caught
a passing glimpse as she crashed along the line,
my fox, and thirty-seven hares. My fox I say,
but I was doomed to find myself mistaken. It
seems after he had been to all intents and purposes
killed, he had crawled along the line and lain down
to die in front of the Cossack colonel. This
worthy gave him the <i>coup de grâce</i>, and claimed
him in consequence. The red deer too, whose
throat a Cossack’s bullet had cut as neatly as if it
had been done with a knife, staggered on towards
the colonel, and here, as its knees trembled preparatory
to lurching forward in death, that gallant
officer put a charge of small shot in its haunch,
spoilt the venison, and secured another easy prey.
The rule of the chase is here opposed to the English
rule, and, I think, to common sense. With
us the man who inflicts the first wound, with the
Russians he who deals the last, obtains the quarry.</p>

<p>After two more beats, in which more game of
the same kind was bagged, we repaired to the
sledges at the cross rides for refreshment. I was
much amused by the doling out of the vodka to
the Cossacks. The cask was mounted on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
sledge and there tapped, the forester, with three or
four to help him, forming the Cossacks in line, and
giving each man his nip in rotation, which he
pitched straight down his throat in true Russian
style, without ever giving the liquid time to wet
the sides in passing. As the men went down after
taking their nip, I noticed they coolly fell in again
at the other end, and in time got another turn.
One enormously tall fellow in a white sheepskin
hat, which must have been double the height and
circumference of an English ‘topper,’ with a crown
of green cloth, got three drams in this way. But
his hat and his height betrayed him, and put an
end to the affair.</p>

<p>During the rest of the drives the sport varied
very little; first came the wolves, slinking out
almost before the beaters had entered the other
side of the covert, then the deer, wild cats, and
foxes in regular succession, and last of all the roes
and hares. If there had been boars or bears I
believe they would probably have followed the
wolves and preceded the deer. But there were
none seen all day.</p>

<p>When the game was counted out at evening
the bag was one red deer, nine roe, two wild cats
(splendid yellow tabbies, half as large again as a
large domestic mouser), three foxes, two skunks,
much prized for their pelts, and 175 hares, and this
divided amongst some twenty guns, of whom two-thirds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
acted only as scarecrows to the game. The
sport was good and wild enough in itself, but poor
and without charm as compared to the still hunt
of the night before.</p>

<p>Arrived at the forester’s house, the hares were
given as wages to the beaters, who exchanged their
skins for vodka from some neighbouring drinking
shop, and made a vast stew of the carcases.
With an enormous bonfire blazing, they made themselves
merry on this rough fare until late into the
night, dancing wild, graceful flings and reels, and
singing national songs, in which a tone of melancholy
and depression seemed to run through the
warlike character of a border ballad.</p>

<p>The whole scene was one which Turner’s
pencil might have gloried in, but no pen could do
justice to the wild figures in their ragged sheepskins
and mountainous hats of many-coloured wool,
lit up by the long red flames, and backed by the
hoary forest heavy with its months of snow.</p>

<p>In the morning before leaving Crasnoi Lais we
saw a very curious instance of the sagacity of
wolves. A herd of roebuck had settled down in
fancied security in a hollow in the midst of one of
the forest sections. A pack of wolves had discovered
them there, and when we came in the
morning the forester showed us plainly by their
spoor their method of attack. At every few hundred
yards round the entire circumference of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
‘quartal’ a wolf had entered it, and the whole
pack gradually converging towards the centre had
surrounded and killed three of the roes, which in
rushing from one wolf must have dashed right into
the jaws of another. My friend told me that he
himself had been witness of another instance of the
wolf’s cunning whilst driving on the post-road in
winter. A cow and her calf were feeding by the
road side, and two wolves were endeavouring to
carry off the calf. One of them kept frolicking
about in front of the cow, rolling on the ground or
snapping at her nose, to distract her attention, the
calf meanwhile getting under her mother in rear.
Here the second wolf attacked her, and seemed in a
fair way to accomplish his object when my friend
drove by.</p>

<p>The natives have many wonderful tales to tell
of wolves, of which perhaps the most incredible is
that if, when you are pursued by a pack, you have
the presence of mind to squat down on your
haunches, the wolves will come and surround you
in a similar attitude, and after some time spent in
contemplation will slowly retire, leaving you unmolested.
I can only say that the man who had
faith enough to put this to the proof would deserve
to live to tell the tale. It is in spring, when
the she-wolf is followed by a party of her grim
suitors, that the Tscherkesses and Cossacks most
dread this animal, and then they say they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
extremely dangerous, and that if you are unlucky
enough to wound the lady, nothing but their death
will release you from the attacks of her enraged
suite.</p>

<p>Having bid a hearty adieu to our host, and
taking a couple of roebuck with us to testify of our
prowess to envious friends at Kertch, we got under
weigh next morning on our return journey. On
our way I wounded an old wolf which I saw
slinking round some kamish (reed) beds by the
roadside; but though I followed him far into the
reeds I never bagged him, and could by no means
get another fair shot at him with my rifle.</p>

<p>Three days’ fast travelling saw us back at
Kertch, the heroes of the hour; for though Ekaterinodar
with its forest is so near, the Russian sportsman
is of so unenterprising a nature that none of
our comrades knew it except by report. The
comforts of our English consulate were none the
less appreciated after the cold bare rooms of a
Russian post station in the Caucasus, and we both
agreed that though such sport was glorious, a comfortable
home to return to was a blessing mightily
to be desired.</p>

<p>It was not until the August of 1878, three years
after the events recorded in my last chapter, that
a passage in a recently published book on the Caucasus
drew my attention again to my old hunting
grounds. It was Mr. Freshfield in this work (‘The
Frosty Caucasus’) who wrote that in all his travels
in the Caucasian mountains he had seen little more
game than a couple of tame bears in a Tscherkess
village.</p>

<p>This struck me as strange, and as I was at that
time meditating a sporting tour in some as yet unchosen
locality, I decided to go to the Caucasus for
myself, and test its capacities to the utmost of my
ability as hunting ground for large game. Since
my return from Asia I have seen Devouasseux, Mr.
Freshfield’s guide, who tells me that the author
was too intent on his favourite pursuit of mountain-climbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
to have much time for looking for game.
And indeed the book itself leads one to infer
this. The climbing of almost impracticable mountains
and the pursuit of great game could not be
combined by any one. To achieve success in
either pursuit is enough for most men.</p>

<p>After passing a week in preparing my outfit,
which was by no means a formidable one, I was
ready to start. An ‘express rifle,’ a double-barrel
smoothbore (C. F. No. 12), fitted with metal
cartridge-cases, which when inserted converted the
gun into a muzzle-loader, a suit of moleskin, one of
Rouch’s photographic apparatuses, and a pair of
Dean’s field boots, were the chief items in my
outfit. The first three articles are indispensable, the
other two absolutely useless, as I was unable to
work the one, and had but little occasion to test the
other. Besides, I believe Mr. Dean’s boots are not
much good without the dubbin supplied with
them, and this my servant promptly lost. No
doubt properly used with this, they are as excellent
as their many advocates believe them to be.</p>

<p>The most difficult thing to get was a really good
map of the Caucasus, containing the names of the
principal small streams and villages. This I afterwards
secured in Russia under the name of ‘Map of
the Caucasian Isthmus,’ by Professor Dr. Karl Koch
(‘Karte von dem Kaukasischen Isthmus,’ Berlin,
1850). In this map most of the important villages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
are marked, and the names are sufficiently like those
given them by their inhabitants to enable a stranger
to recognise them.</p>

<p>The journey from St. Katherine’s Docks to
Odessa, <i>viâ</i> Vienna, has nothing in it worthy
of record. Most men who travel nowadays have
seen as much of it as they care to. For my own
part, having made the journey several times, I
think the things that have made most impression
on my mind are the gradual improvement in the
railway carriages, from the time you leave our
English abominations until the time you find yourself
surrounded with at least all the necessary conveniences
of life on the last stage to Odessa; the
gradual diminution in pace, until some little distance
from your journey’s end it amounts to little
more than a crawl; the sudden clearing and
brightening of the atmosphere once you have crossed
the channel; the predominance of blue in all the
dresses of the French peasant; the absence of
fences to make a run interesting, if runs took place
in this land of vulpecides; the disappearance of the
rook, and the appearance of his grey-backed congener
the hooded crow in his place; the multitude
of magpies, and the loquaciousness of one’s travelling
companions. I am afraid my readers, if I
have any, will at once put me down as unobservant,
but it may only be that first impressions are
lost if the same journey is often repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Arrived at Odessa, my old chief and kind
friend, Mr. George Stanley, Her Majesty’s Consul-General
there, received me with great kindness,
and to him and Mr. Mitchell I am indebted for
much valuable information and many acts of
attention. During the few days I stayed at
Odessa I had one very excellent day’s snipe-shooting
with Mr. Stanley on the Dnieper, during which
we bagged fifty-six snipe in an hour between
us. Of these, I am in honesty bound to admit,
that Mr. Stanley, whose hand had not forgotten
the cunning acquired in Egypt, bagged by far the
larger share.</p>

<p>On our way home we had a specimen of the
driving of Russian yemstchiks, which would have
considerably lowered them probably in the esteem
of their ardent admirer Sir Robert Peel. Our
fellow seemed a little the worse for vodka, and as
soon as we got away from the house at which we
had been staying, we had proof that his looks did
not belie him. The bracing air roused his spirits;
his horses were ‘little doves’ and ‘sons of dogs’
in the same breath, his whip whirled about, and
tossing their heads in the air, the team (in which
there were two young ones) took the bit in their
teeth, and went away straight across the steppe, over
gullies, with a bump that would have smashed
any springs had there been any, down slopes
at a rate that took your breath away, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the while the yemstchik laughing and swearing,
and not minding one bit. Two of his crimson
velvet cushions dropped off into darkness behind
him, and this probably sobered him. At last we
got on to the track, and though the pace was still
violent, we were comparatively safe here. Once we
collided with a droshky, the driver of which was
unusually moderate in his oaths at the accident,
and passed on quickly and disappeared. We discovered
afterwards that a valuable piece of the
harness of our own troika had been lost, carried
away by the droshky in the collision probably,
seeing which the droshky man had held his tongue,
and made off with his prize.</p>

<p>But our troubles were not yet over. As we
neared Odessa there was a sharp turn in the track.
As we turned I saw our danger, but there was no
time to avert it; and in the twinkling of an eye we
charged a telegraph post. The tall thin post passing
between our off leader and the shaft horse, cut clean
through every atom of harness, and set the young
one free. For a moment he stood stunned and
trembling, and then with a snort betook himself off
into the darkness as fast as legs could carry him.
This finally restored our driver to a state of most
solemn sobriety, and for the rest of our journey we
were conveyed at a safe and moderate pace by the
remaining two horses. The fellow was lucky
enough to recover his horse next day, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
without considerable trouble and expense. I believe
he and two or three hired comrades spent the
night on the steppe looking for the stray horse.</p>

<p>After this I bade adieu to my kind friends in
Odessa, receiving as a last kindness from Mr.
Stanley an introduction to Prince Vorontzoff, who,
luckily for me, happened to be travelling by the
boat in which I had embarked. This introduction
stood me in good stead, as his Highness, who
speaks English like an Englishman, gave me letters
of introduction at Tiflis, by exhibiting the address
and external signature of which I was able to allay
the suspicions of the Cossacks on the Black Sea,
and otherwise help myself. I owe Prince Vorontzoff
many thanks for his ready kindness to
a stranger, and repeat them with the same sincerity
with which I tendered them when he left the boat
for his lovely place at Aloupka.</p>

<p>Aloupka is to my mind the finest castle in
Russia, in the most picturesque position. It is a
strange mixture of the half fortress, half castle, of
early feudal times, Moorish magnificence, Russian
luxury, and English comfort. In the distance it
looks massive and glorious, with magnificent
timber, gardens, and vineyards stretching down to
the sea at its feet, the grey summit of Aië Petri
towering over it from behind, and away to the
right the Bear Mountain, couched with his head
on his paws, looking ever seaward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Yalta itself is the Eden of Russia perhaps,
but it is an Eden in which most of the inhabitants
are invalids, all the hotels infamously exorbitant
in their charges; and life, unless one is
addicted to the process of the grape cure, excessively
monotonous. The palace of Livadia is
beautiful, but would, I think, scarcely please
ordinary English taste as much as the magnificent
foliage (artificially arranged) at Orianda (the
Grand Duke Constantine’s seat), or the stately
beauty of Aloupka. The mountains round Yalta
and as far as Theodosia are extremely fine, and
I know of few things more beautiful than some
of the views to be obtained from their pine-clad
sides. I believe a few roe and chamois are to
be found on them, but these are at least partially
preserved.</p>

<p>Arrived at Kertch I was at home again, and
soon in my old room at the consulate. A right
merry time we had of it, and, as was natural,
devoted a couple of days to our old friend Miskitchee,
the lake that ‘best of all lakes the
fowler loves,’ on these Crimean steppes.</p>

<p>Miskitchee is the Tartar name for a village
some sixty versts from Kertch: the lake, which
adjoins the village, shares with the latter its
name. The lake is a piece of shallow water
some two miles long by half a mile broad, and
nowhere deeper than up to a man’s waist. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
for the most part covered with the high reed
called here ‘kamish,’ and on the mud banks round
its edges and in the little lagoons within the reeds
myriads of wild-fowl play by day, and chatter
and feed all night. Here have I had many a
good day’s wild-fowling, passed many a merry
night, and had at least one adventure, which, as
far as I remember, was somewhat in this wise:
I had been staying at the house of the chief
farmer in the village, a Greek or Armenian&mdash;I
forget which&mdash;for some few days, on a shooting
expedition. One morning, about six o’clock, I
was tramping over some damp steppeland, where
pools were frequent, and snipe should have been
more so, but were not. After an hour spent in
looking for something to shoot, I had almost
resolved to be off again to my favourite lake, when
I heard a voice calling to me in Russian. Looking
up I saw a Tartar, rather a smart one too, in a
fawn-coloured robe and the inevitable sheepskin
hat, standing upright in a big flat cart, with a
troika of capital horses before him. On coming
closer I found he was inviting me to take a seat in
his cart, assuring me that he, too, was a sportsman,
and had to drive over a part of the steppe
that morning where game abounded. Having
no gun with him, he would show me where sport
might be had if I liked. However, roubles in
those days were rare with me, and I feared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
if I accepted the lift I should have to pay a considerable
fare, so I declined as graciously as possible.
My friend persisted, and at last I told him
frankly that if he gave me a passage to these happy
hunting grounds of which he spoke it would have
to be a free one, and include a return before nightfall.
He consented at once, so without more ado
I got into his cart, and drove off with him.</p>

<p>After a verst or two I began to find my friend
was no ‘blagueur,’ for in a very short time we had
bagged several hares and a few quail. His sight
was the most marvellous I ever met with. Standing
up in his cart, as he drove rapidly over the
uplands, he would from time to time pull up
suddenly, exclaiming, ‘Vot zeits!’&mdash;Lo, a hare!
at the same time pointing to some distant object
on the ploughed land or prairie. It was no good
my looking, for I could discern nothing, so that I
had to dismount and simply trudge for one or two
hundred yards in the direction he indicated, until
sure enough, from under my very feet, the hare
started, until then utterly undiscernible to me.</p>

<p>And now the object of his morning drive was
revealed to me. On a hillside near us was a
mighty flock of sheep, tended by a few ragged
Tartar lads and one grey-headed shepherd, with
the usual retinue of huge mongrel sheepdogs&mdash;brutes
who go for you on every opportunity.
Hailing the old shepherd, a bargain was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
struck, and we dismounted to choose our sheep.
My friend plunged in among them, and after
regarding many with the eye of a profound connoisseur,
chose four. To choose them was easy, to
secure them seemed less so. Kicking off his shoes
and rolling up his long loose sleeves, the purchaser
tried to approach his purchase. The more he advanced
the more rapidly the sheep retired, trying in
vain to lose himself amongst his comrades or substitute
another in his place. But the Tartar was
not to be done, and in a quarter of an hour three
were secured, caught by the hind leg, jerked over
on their back, all four legs tied together, and
bundled into the cart. Ambitious of imitating my
friend, I too took off my boots, and made frantic
efforts to collar an innocent-looking beast. After
an enormous waste of time I did get hold of a leg
of mutton, though not, I believe, the right one.
The jerk was neatly given, but alas! not by the
right creature. In a moment I was sprawling, and
in another the whole flock was romping over my
breathless body. How I extricated myself I know
not, but when I did I sat me down, feeling sheepish
in more ways than one, and resumed my boots
a wiser, though a sadder man.</p>

<p>Having got our whole cargo on board, we set
off for the nearest Tartar village, killing on the
way another hare. By the way, whenever I killed
anything, my guide insisted on cutting its throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and breaking its legs, a superstitious observance,
I have since heard, common to all Mahometans.
Arrived at the village, an old man (the moollah I
think he was) climbed to the top of a low hovel in
the middle of the straggling main street (if streets
there are in Tartar ‘aouls’), and shouted himself
hoarse in the Tartar tongue. What he said I knew
not then, but from subsequent events I believe it
was to the effect that the good butcher, Lotso, had
brought with him five fat sheep, all or any of
which he was prepared then and there to convert
into mutton, if sufficient customers were forthcoming.
Any one who wanted mutton, to raise
his hand. After a great deal of talking all by
himself, the moollah came down from his perch,
and a crowd forming round him, a tremendous
row ensued. It looked like being a free fight, but
it was soon over, and perhaps the Tartar housekeepers
may take to themselves the credit of settling
on the joint for the day sooner than their English
representatives at home.</p>

<p>The purchases being settled, a sheep was selected
from the cart, and carried to a stone trench
hard-by, its throat cut, and the whole operation of
skinning and dismembering completed in a very
few minutes. Meanwhile a number of gaunt curs,
drawn by the smell of blood, had crowded round,
and so hardy were they that it was all a dozen
Tartars could do, whirling their knouts round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
butcher as the whips do when the huntsman is
breaking up his fox, to keep the brutes at bay.
Then the meat was parcelled out, the money paid,
cash down, the entrails, tied up in the skin
(butcher’s perquisites), thrown back into the cart,
and after a drink of sour cream at the dirty brown
hands of a Tartar princess, we were on our way
for the next village, to repeat the same process.</p>

<p>And now all our sheep having been slaughtered
and sold, the gloaming came on, and with it a
hunger on my part that made me anxious to get
back to my quarters at the friendly Armenian’s.
Turning to the Tartar, I suggested our return,
when he coolly informed me that I had better make
up my mind to pass the night at his house at J&mdash;&mdash;,
naming a village of some half-dozen houses, at
which an execrable murder had occurred some
months previously. It may have been the memory
of this, or it may have been his ghastly handiness
with the butcher’s knife, or perhaps the thought of
my cosy quarters at Miskitchee, that made me
resolve that go to that place I would not. Accordingly
I reminded him of his promise. All the
satisfaction I could get was that if I wanted to go
back I must walk. Did I know in which direction
Miskitchee lay? Yes, out yonder, over that low
line of hills. A grim laugh, and the assurance that
Miskitchee was in an exactly opposite direction,
increased my suspicions of my quondam friend, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
knew by certain landmarks that he must be lying.
A moment’s consideration showed me that a walk
at this hour, even supposing I did not lose my way,
would end probably in a night on the steppe, at the
mercy of this man or any other who chose to stalk
me, and surprise me in the dark or in my sleep, to
say nothing of the absolute necessity in case of
my leaving the cart of abandoning my game. So
I changed my tactics. He had no fire-arms, and
sat on the edge of the cart. I had my gun, and sat
behind in the body of it. Mustering what little
Russian I knew, I let him understand that I held
him to his promise; that I had heard of J&mdash;&mdash; and its
evil reputation, and didn’t mean to go there; that
I knew the track now on our right was the home
track; and that, if he refused to take it, I would
blow him off his cart with a charge of No. 5. This
was a rough argument, and he seemed nonplussed.
He tried to argue me into going another way; he
tried to laugh me out of my suspicions&mdash;he even
began to bully. I simply watched him, repeated
my proposals, and sat still. Meanwhile the horses
were pulled up. Then my friend tried to slip off
his seat, and so get out of his awkward position in
front of my gun’s muzzle. I cocked my gun with
a click, and brought it in a line with his back. There
was a moment’s hesitation, and then with a curse
he took the right road at a sulky pace.</p>

<p>All that drive I never took my eyes off him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and never let go my gun. Gradually he seemed
to become better tempered, and when we got within
half a mile of Miskitchee he turned and spoke to me,
to assure me that further than that nothing would
induce him to drive me.</p>

<p>Satisfied now that I could get home in safety,
I got down, taking a couple of hares and some birds
with me, leaving the rest for the Tartar, and walked
off to Miskitchee, thankful to have got off so well. On
my way back I thought I had probably been over
suspicious, and made a fool of myself. However, on
my arrival, I found I had been searched for all day,
and great anxiety had been felt for me. It seems
my butcher was of more professions than one, being
indeed the most notorious horse-stealer on these
steppes. He had camped near the village the night
before, and made several inquiries about me, having
seen me returning from shooting that night. He
had also expressed great admiration for my gun, a
rather handsome breech-loader. This, together with
the fact that the butcher, one of my host’s best
horses, and myself had all disappeared simultaneously
next morning, accounted for the anxiety felt,
as well as for the butcher’s objection to return to
the village that night.</p>

<p>Such was one of the memories Miskitchee
called up in my mind. But on this my last visit
I saw little to remind me of my adventure. The
Armenian had, I believe, gone, and the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
village looked asleep in the sunshine as we passed it
by: a straggling group of one-storied hovels, with
the sunlight glinting on rows of yellow gourds on
the thatch; a dark, good-looking Tartar girl in a
scarlet cap and many ringlets, much bespangled
with small gilt coins, standing in a doorway,
round which there was some sort of an enclosure.
At another cottage door, with his legs in the mud
of the main street and his quarters on the somewhat
drier mud of his dining-room floor, lounged, cigarette
in mouth, a pink-shirted Russian moujik.
Inside the hovel, if we had had time to look, we
should probably have seen a heap of bedclothes
between the roof and the top of the oven; this
would be the baboushka’s (grandmother’s) bed.
A wooden bedstead with more disarranged clothes
on the floor; here the rest of the family, mother
and father and brats, all sleep; a filthy, open fire-place,
in one corner; a ragged woman, of ape-like
propensities, combing a dirty child in another; and
on the floor two more half-naked brats, fighting
over the family loaf of black bread, from which
they are in vain endeavouring to hammer a morsel
with the back of an axe. From a blackened
greasy beam overhead, adorned with a few strings
of onions and withered apples, a dim light shines
down upon the whole, proceeding from a tin of
mutton fat, which makes the whole interior as unsavoury
as it is ugly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Gladly, then, we left the village behind us, and
drawing up our droshkies under the lee of a high
natural embankment beside the lake, prepared to
pass the night there. A hole was dug in the earth
and a subterranean fire made to cook over. Our
bourkas stretched over the droshky made a kind of
refuge between the wheels, into which we could
crawl and sleep in case of rain.</p>

<p>These and other little preparations having been
at least started, we began our shooting. Two guns
went round the lake, one on either side; one
worthy sportsman might have been seen arraying
himself in Mr. Cording’s famous hose; another,
simpler and perhaps wiser, divesting himself of all
the trammels which civilisation has thrown round
the lower limbs of bipeds. The wading party,
Cording’s follower, and ‘the unadorned,’ made
through the shallow lake for the reed beds in
the centre; here carefully concealed to reap the
benefit of the stalking party on either shore. The
fifth gunner, a tall thin German from Riga, the very
best of good fellows, with the longest of legs, had
taken to himself a large biscuit-tin, the which he
had deposited on a small sand-bank in the middle
of the lake. Seated on this, in his trim attire,
which no campaigning could ever make less natty,
with long limbs overspreading all the surrounding
country, our friend B. awaited the dodgy duck.
The men in the reeds had the best of it, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the shooting was hardest there, and as we had no
retrievers we never got a quarter of the birds we
killed. The isolated gentleman on the biscuit-tin
got a few long shots, and as his birds all fell in
open water, got most of what he killed. But, alas,
when he attempted to rise to gather his birds, he
was distinctly seen to stick. Vain were his efforts
to rise erect. The misguided biscuit-tin had sunk
into the treacherous mud bank, slowly but surely;
the part next upon it had followed, and the pride
of Kertch had apparently taken root in the wastes
of Miskitchee. However, fate was kind, and by
the united efforts of his friends he was rescued
from his ignominious position.</p>

<p>The shore shooters came back tired but happy,
though their bag of one cormorant, several red-legged
gulls, and a large variety of waders, with a
few duck, was rather ornamental than useful. The
man of the biscuit-tin and ‘the unadorned’ contributed
some mallards, teal, and a couple of pintail,
with a few snipe; and after counting out the
bag, all drew round the fire to imbibe the cheering
‘tchai’ (tea). But why this gap? Our friend in
waders is still absent, and yell loud as we like we
get no response from the little reedy island in
which he was last seen. For half an hour we
waited, and then we heard a gun fired right in the
middle of the swamp. Again we shouted and
fired, and this time got an answer, but it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
until the sky grew dark and the smoke from our fire
could be plainly seen against it, that our friend
found his way out of the maze of reeds in which
he had been wandering round and round for nearly
a couple of hours.</p>

<p>After our pipes had been lighted, the rain came
down in torrents, forcing us all to creep under
the droshky, and a very close fit we found it.
However, by curling B.’s legs three or four times
round his waist, we did manage it, and lay there
smoking and listening to the old German jäger’s
ghost stories, culled from the forests of Germany
and the plains of Asia, until far into the night.
And never had a teller of weird legends fitter
accompaniments than the million voices of the lake
at our feet and the ceaseless pelting and buffeting
of the storm without.</p>

<p>One more shot at the duck in the morning,
and then we turned homewards. My time I felt
was getting short, and it was high time that I
sailed for the Black Sea coast, although I was
nothing loth to have delayed these two weeks,
feeling that now I was tolerably certain to escape
the Circassian fever which is so prevalent in early
autumn.</p>

<p>On Saturday, October 7, I left Kertch for Ekaterinodar,
intending to have a week’s sport at my
old quarters in the Crasnoi Lais (Red Forest),
having written to that effect to Colonel R., the
forester, about a week before. My impedimenta
were a portmanteau, my gun and rifle, together
with a pointer (Calypso), which I had purchased
from an old shooting companion at Kertch. My
intention was to have some shooting in the Suran
district, where bears are said to be plentiful, to
stay a few days at Vladikavkas, thence to pass on
to Tiflis, and from Tiflis across the little known
Mooghan Steppe to the Caspian. But it is hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
worth while to mention my plans, as they nearly
all suffered change, and it would have been better
for me if they all had.</p>

<p>At Taman, whilst the horses were being harnessed,
I was kindly entertained by the chief of the
Russian Telegraph station, from whom I gained
a good deal of general information. I may say
once for all, that wherever I went I met with
the kindest attention from the employés of the
Telegraph Companies, whether Russian or Indo-European,
and I heartily commend to their kindness
any one who may be inclined to follow on
my steps. But the jingling bells, whose ceaseless
monotony was to be my only music through many a
day to come, warn me to drink up my coffee, light
a pipe for the journey, and be off.</p>

<p>The country round Taman had improved somewhat
since I saw it last. People used to declare
nothing would grow there; but now that some
Greeks have settled round the town, fine onions
and other garden produce are daily sent in, grown
within a mile of the bazaar.</p>

<p>Once well out on the steppe, in a flat open cart,
with no shelter of any kind and retreat impossible,
down came the pitiless rain. No fitful April shower,
but a good conscientious downpour, large drops
and plenty of them, for the rest of the afternoon.
Here, then, was my first omission in fitting out for
an expedition. An umbrella would have looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
ridiculous, and been for various reasons useless;
but the umbrella of the country, the Tscherkess
bourka, should have been among the first of my
purchases.</p>

<p>This bourka, without which no one thinks of
travelling in this country, is a large piece of felt,
of a good quality, extremely light for its size, and
really waterproof. It fastens round the wearer’s
neck, and hangs like a bell-shaped tent from his
shoulders to his knees. Bourkas vary in texture
and quality, as well as price; some being white,
others black; some as rough as a Skye terrier, others
almost as smooth as a greyhound. The best are
black and almost smooth, and cost as much as
thirty or forty roubles (four or five pounds). After
his kinjal and his horse, I almost think a bourka
is the Cossack’s most valuable possession; and rolled
in these things, I have seen the hardy fellows
sleeping placidly on a wet truss of hay in the midst
of a perfect November deluge.</p>

<p>After going for a verst or so, my yemstchik came
to his first halt. The horses here wear their tails,
like the ladies’ trains at home, preposterously long;
and a dozen times in our drive of twenty versts, had
we to pull up whilst the driver wrung out the mud
from one of these sweeping appendages, and tied it
up into a less comely but more convenient bob.
Without this the horses could not have done the
distance at all. As for myself, I was speedily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
sodden through, while my face was like that of a
plaster cast with its eyes bunged up.</p>

<p>It is a pitiful thing to see all this useful land
untilled, and all the peasantry and the country
itself so poor. My friend the Russian telegraph
clerk told me a few more reasons besides the perpetual
‘prasnik’ for the want of agricultural energy
and success in the Caucasus. The very abundance
of land is an evil to the short-sighted Russian
peasant. Here in the Caucasus I am told every
‘soul’ (the Russian phrase for every male subject)
is allowed sixteen dissatines (acres) free of charge,
and he may choose his land pretty well where he
likes. The result is, the moujik argues with himself
pretty much after this fashion: ‘In this particular
spot where my cottage is, my corn won’t
grow well, elsewhere it would grow better, and in
a third place another crop would find a fitter soil.’
So on this principle of not trusting all his ventures
to one bottom, he takes a few dissatines here and
another few ten versts off, and still more beyond.
In this way he wastes an infinite amount of time in
making perhaps a threshing floor at each different
farm, or in conveying the crop from one farm to
another to be threshed. Add to this that water has
often to be fetched from afar, that his tools are of
the rudest, and that his men are, even if all were
workers even in the English sense, far too small for
the acreage, and you have some reasons for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
want of that agricultural wealth which Russia
ought to possess. It seems the greater pity, since
the moujik is such a frugal, hard-living man, and
barring vodka and ‘prasniks’ might do wonders.
He can turn his hand to anything, is always cheerful,
and almost his only glaring vice is drunkenness.
A peasant family here, I am assured, will live in
what is to them comfort, food and clothes and all
included, for from eighteen to twenty roubles a
head, <i>i.e.</i> from 2<i>l.</i> to 2<i>l.</i> 5.<i>s.</i>, per annum. But
then we must bear in mind that meat is a thing
a Russian peasant rarely eats. In spring black
bread and an onion; in summer black bread and
arboose (water-melon); in winter black bread and
cabbage soup, with a dry fish now and again as a
<i>bonne bouche</i>, suffice for his simple wants. Then,
too, his liquor is infinitely cheaper than that of our
beer-drinking peasantry. For three copecks (about
a penny) he can get nearly half an English tumbler
of the abominable neat rye spirit, in which he delights,
and some of them will even drink spirits of
wine and petroleum, which, I presume, is even
cheaper than vodka.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the oil-wells at Tcheerilek,
Mr. Peters&mdash;since, I regret to say, dead&mdash;has himself
told me that some men working on his estate
thought as little of tossing off a ‘stakan’ (small
tumbler) of petroleum as I would of drinking the
like quantity of Bass. In addition to these things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the moujik’s clothes are as simple and inexpensive
as his diet: in winter a toga of sheepskin, with the
woolly side in, a scarf round his waist and sheepskin
hat on his head, a pair of long boots that cost
him more than all the rest of his outfit, but are unrivalled
for their long wearing qualities; in summer
a calico shirt; and summer and winter you may
see his wife and brats going about, in snow or sunshine,
with nothing but a single linen garment
between them and the weather. His winter outfit
is perhaps a trifle costly, as compared to the rest of
his expenditure, but then it is wonderful how long
one suit of clothes will last a moujik; and like a
wise man he always prefers old clothes to new, so
long as they will hold together.</p>

<p>With such a thrifty peasantry, and so much
valuable land, surely better results might be
obtained.</p>

<p>I believe that the whole of the misery of Russia,
her political discontent, her Nihilism, and the foul
crimes of which it has been the cause, are due, not
to the autocratic form of government under which
she exists, and to which, in spite of the outcry of
the few, the majority of Russians are firmly wedded,
but to the utter want of religious training amongst
all classes, and to that widespread corruption in the
official world, from which all who come in contact
with it suffer continually. Were there less compulsory
military service, more religious training,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
greater encouragement given to agriculture, and
more inducements held out to foreigners to settle in
the waste places of Russia’s vast empire, so that by
their example they might teach her own people
how to make the best of the natural advantages
they enjoy, there might then be a chance of happiness
and prosperity for Russia and her people.</p>

<p>There is in every Russian moujik an inherent
love of the Czar, a personal loyalty to him, which
deifies and renders its object infallible in the eyes of
his subjects, and this takes much to eradicate.
Could this feeling be fostered rather than destroyed
by the injustices of petty provincial officials, who
to the peasant are the only direct representatives of
the supreme power, regicide and revolution would
be things unknown.</p>

<p>The only complaint I ever heard from peasant
lips in Russia of the Great White Czar was, he is
too far off, he is deaf, our voices cannot reach him
through the crowd of rascals who hedge him in.</p>

<p>To-day I myself was destined to dine on
peasants’ fare; and though the bread was black and
damp, it was wholesome, and hunger gave the
meal the only sauce it needed. My night was
passed on a wooden sofa at Tumerūk, with my
pointer for a pillow, a style of repose that at least
ensured early rising.</p>

<p>At 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I was in the market chaffering with
the peasant women for supplies for the journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Ikra (fresh caviare) was nearly two shillings a
pound, and fresh butter tenpence. It is one of the
unpleasant characteristics of the Russian tradesman
that you must always bargain with him for the
merest trifle. It is only fair to say for him that it
is the fault rather of his customers than himself;
for in Kertch, where we were known, the tradesmen,
knowing that the English residents did not
care to haggle about a bargain, would ask the price
they meant to accept in the first instance, instead
of adding on an extra charge to be gradually taken
off to please the customer.</p>

<p>Whilst waiting in the post-station for my horses
to be put to, I chanced on the following passage in
a Russian book of travels, by one Ivan Goutcharoff,
which I have taken the liberty of translating for
the benefit of my readers. Speaking of his sojourn
in England, he says: ‘I did not make the acquaintance
of any families, so that I only saw the women
in the churches, shops, opera-boxes, streets, &amp;c., so
that I can only say (and that to prevent your being
offended at me for neglecting this subject) that they
are very beautiful, well built, and of a wondrous
complexion, though they eat much meat and sweets
and drink strong wine. Yet in other nations you
will not find so much beauty as among the masses
in England. Don’t judge of English beauty (as
Russians too often do) by the red-haired gentlemen
and dames who come out from England under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
name of skippers, machinists, tutors, and governesses,
above all governesses. That would be a
grand mistake. Beautiful women don’t leave England
for this. Beauty is capital. Women as a race
are worth nothing in England if they have not
some special talent. One foreign language or accomplishment
for children is no great thing, so it
only remains to go to Russia. The greater part of
Englishwomen are tall, well built, rather proud
and calm; according to many even cold. The
colour of their hair is of never-ending variety.’
Such appears to be the judgment of one who evidently
believed himself a connoisseur, and had had,
moreover, an opportunity of studying the far-famed
Circassian belles in their own land.</p>

<p>These Russian post-stations grow worse and
worse; what may be the acme of evil at which I
shall arrive before I reach the Caspian, I dare not
fancy. They are bare of all save a wooden couch;
no carpets, no provisions, no anything, except
the thirstiest of what Mark Twain calls ‘seaside
chamois.’ We passed to-day a Cossack village on
the border of a large lake surrounded by ‘kamish’
jungles, said to be the scene of a strange tragedy in
the Russo-Tscherkess war. ‘A band of Tscherkess
warriors here met a party of Cossacks, who utterly
routed them, and the wretched natives took refuge
in the depths of the ‘kamish’ jungles. Here they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
stayed till nightfall, when the myriads of venomous
mosquitoes, which make their home amongst
these reeds, drove them out, preferring death at the
hands of the Cossacks to slow torture from their
insect foes.’ This is only a tradition, my authority
my yemstchik; but from what I have seen of these
pests myself, I have little doubt of its truth.</p>

<p>The cold is getting quite severe already; all
the quail have gone, and last night there was a full
orchestra of wolves outside the post-station. At
the end of three days we pulled up at the St.
Petersburg Hotel, Ekaterinodar, and if anything
can be worse than post-travelling in Russia, it would
be the disappointment you suffer in the so-called
hotel accommodation. One of a long corridor in
the stable-yard, with only too ample ventilation,
my room stands a whited sepulchre, with an iron
bedstead, a wooden table, a mattress, sheet, and
dirty cushion, no washing utensils of any kind, no
bedclothes, a wicker chair, a broken bottle half full
of doubtful water, and bare boards beneath. Such
is the lodging. For attendance, one dirty little
boy about twelve, and a pigmy for his age, waits
apparently on every one in the house. The cooking,
though not first-rate, is the hotel’s greatest
attraction. Some one talks about man’s heartiest
welcome being at an inn. If he had ever tried a
Russian inn, he would have reconsidered that statement.
Most of the guests at the <i>table-d’hôte</i> are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
officers, from which one would infer that regimental
messes are not in vogue in Russia.</p>

<p>In the morning after my arrival at Ekaterinodar
I was up betimes, and, with a friend whose
acquaintance I had made on my first visit, proceeded
to the fair outside the town to purchase the
indispensable bourka. Thanks to his exertions, I
was, in little more than an hour, the possessor of a
good bourka, sheepskin shouba and cap, all purchased
for about 4<i>l.</i> Attired in the costume of the
country, and speaking the language fluently, if not
well, I am less likely to attract the attention of the
natives, who, I am told, being for the most part
Mussulmen, are bitterly set against the English
just now, ascribing, as they do, the misfortunes of
the Turkish Empire to our cold friendship, for which
they have, I fear, a harder name.</p>

<p>Ekaterinodar must be a prospering town, for I
am told that seven years ago there were only five
stone houses in the place, and now there are upwards
of a thousand. The old houses were built
of reeds washed over with a kind of cement. The
fever, too, I am told, is on the wane, and, indeed,
it had need to be, for some few years ago there was
no worse fever den in the Caucasus. But now as
the cart-tracks through the town begin to look a
little like streets (though still of the roughest), with
every here and there in the most fashionable quarters
a hundred yards of uneven pavement, and, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
help of constant pruning and uprooting, the houses
begin to peep less blindly through the trees, while
a tolerably vigorous town government prevents the
deposit of filth in the public thoroughfares, the
back of the fever has been broken.</p>

<p>The wonderful richness of the soil is sufficiently
shown by a statement made to me by a settler here
to-day: ‘If I don’t clear my garden three times a
year from new growths, I should be unable to force
a way through it at the end of a twelvemonth.’
It was in his garden that I saw this afternoon some
of the largest gourds I ever set eyes on, some
weighing over eighty pounds, while he assured me
that they sometimes reached as much as 120 or
130 pounds. The people here make a substance
called cassia of them, on which they live, and with
which they feed their pigs.</p>

<p>Trade seemed to be very brisk in the town. The
fair was crowded, the shops full, and the streets
alive with conveyances of every description. The
number of military stationed here appears considerable,
and the barracks are fairly imposing edifices.</p>

<p>Ekaterinodar boasts of two cathedrals, of which
the old one, now in disuse, is to my mind the finest.
At night I visited the fair again, and a very lively
scene I found it. Out in the open stood numerous
little tables, at which nips of vodka and other liqueurs
were dispensed, for the most part by German Jews,
to little crowds of half-drunk Cossacks. Close by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
through the open doorway of a tent, you caught
the glare of a huge fire and your nostrils a savoury
smell of roasting mutton. Feeling hungry, I entered
at one of these open doors, and found myself
in a Kalmuck refreshment booth, with two or three
dead sheep hanging round the tent-pole and a big
semi-subterranean fire at the farther end. Here
several wild-looking Tartars were devilling little
knobs of mutton on a skewer; and purchasing two
or three of these skewers, with their savoury burden
on them all hissing from the coals, we made the
best meal I have yet partaken of in the Caucasus.
To wash this down we ordered Kalmuck tea, evidently
quite the thing to drink here. The tea is
pressed in huge cake-like bricks, and is apparently
of no very high quality. A square of this is hacked
off, boiled down in a pot, and the tea served up in
one soup-bowl between two, with a spoon apiece.
It is correct to add to it milk, huge lumps of
butter, and pepper and salt to taste, when it resembles
soup a good deal more than tea.</p>

<p>It was not until 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> next day (Thursday)
that I managed to get my ‘podorojna’ (travelling
ticket) and other things in order. At that hour it
was really too late to start on my long drive to the
Red Forest, but I was so sick of delays that I
determined to get as far as I could that night, and
trust to luck for the rest. My yemstchik, who
had only a misty notion of the whereabouts of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
journey’s end, was a most melancholy fellow, and
regaled me for the first hour or more with stories
of horrible murders and atrocities which had lately
taken place in or near Ekaterinodar, and would
have made the fortune of ‘Lloyd’s Weekly.’ They
spoke little for the efficiency of the police in the
Caucasus; but then a more miserable lot than the
Russian police generally, I never saw. They are
the smallest and worst men (physically) in the
army, and, as such, are drafted into the police
force. They wear a sword which they use to protect
themselves against dogs, attacking small curs
with this formidable weapon with the greatest
ferocity. I speak here of what I have seen. If
they have a chance they are, I am assured by Russians,
more likely to assist thieves than to hinder
them, and the following true story, which came
under the knowledge of a British Consul, may serve
to illustrate their ordinary conduct when applied
to as protectors of person or property:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘A certain lady, resident in the Crimea, but not
a native, found her silver forks rapidly disappearing
in a manner difficult to explain. These forks were
twelve in number, and marked with a crest or monogram.
One only remained at last, and in despair
she searched the box of a Russian servant in her
employ, whom she had reason to suspect of dishonesty.
Here she found the eleven missing forks,
and, without disturbing them, sent for the police,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
made them search the servant’s box, and thus the
culprit was taken red-handed. The servant was
removed to prison, so were the forks. Time passed,
nothing was done. At last, tired of waiting, the
lady applied to know what was to be done in the
matter, and how soon; at least, she pleaded, the
forks might now be returned to her. The answer
was, that it was necessary that the police should
have the other fork in order that they might identify
the eleven as her property. In a weak moment
she sent her twelfth fork to them. The set was
complete. In a short time the servant was released,
and in spite of all her expostulations this luckless
lady never saw her forks again.’ This occurred in
the Crimea; the Caucasus is, I believe, under military
law, yet before I had passed my six months
in the country, I was destined to become so familiar
with stories of murders and atrocities committed
here from day to day, as to think little of
them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thinking and chatting of these
things, we had found our way by 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> to the
forester’s cottage. A huge fire was blazing outside,
at which half a dozen grim-looking Cossacks
were smoking and toasting their toes. Inside the
cottage the cigarettes had gone out, and puffing a
last long whiff of smoke through his nostrils, the
head-forester had betaken himself to dreamland.
The Cossacks told us he had guests to-night, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
had not expected me. Remembering that a man
roused from his first sleep is not always in his
sweetest mood, I determined not to disturb mine
host, but instead took my place amongst the Cossack
guards by the fire, and in spite of their looks
of wonder and ridicule, prepared to be comfortable
in my own way. After some delay a kettle was
produced, and taking some tea from my game sack,
I soon brewed the odorous beverage, by sharing
which with my rough companions I gained considerably
in their good graces. The night was
fearfully cold, and the stories the Cossacks told
almost unintelligible to me, owing to the patois in
which they told them, so that my pipe once out I
was ready to turn in. One thing I ought to say
for these men, uncouth as they appeared. When I
knelt for a few minutes before turning in, every
one of them rose, left the vicinity of the fire, and
remained respectfully standing until I was on my
legs again; and I may add, that wherever I have
met Cossacks I have found the same outward
respect at any rate for religious observances, and it
is my firm belief, that though prone to many vices,
they have more faith and a greater respect for the
nobler qualities of humanity, than most of their
more enlightened fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>I slept that night in my bourka on the droshky,
and when I woke, the bourka, which was black the
night before, was silvery with rime, while my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
moustache was quite hard frozen. The forester’s
cheery greeting, and the hot breakfast that followed
it, were welcome things indeed after my
hard night’s rest; and on inspection I found that
I had as usual dropped on my legs at the Red
Forest. The guest spoken of by the Cossacks
was a certain Colonel H., a German, who had come
a long way for a few days’ sport with my old
friend, and great were to be the drives in his
honour.</p>

<p>Our first day was very unproductive, however;
for though we got some red deer on foot in front
of the sleuth-hounds, we never saw them. The
second day was as bad, until the afternoon, when,
on our way back, we heard in another quarter of
the forest a furious crashing, accompanied by
short fierce snortings. Old R.’s little wiry figure
actually stiffened with excitement, and his eyes
became more prominent even than their wont, as
he gripped my arm till it ached. ‘Kabân!’ (boar)
was all he seemed able to get out, and, indeed, I
was little less excited myself. Motioning to the
German to guard the corner of the quartal where
the rides crossed, he stole stealthily along a ride
towards the sounds, stopping every now and then
to listen, but never letting go my unfortunate arm.
The sound was close to us, and now even my
untrained ears told me that the sound was much
like that of pigs in deadly strife. All at once my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
vivacious little friend dropped my arm and pointed
to something in the dense brush. The trees grew
so thick here, and interlaced their limbs so closely,
that the forest shade was as dark as a summer
night, and I could see nothing. My friend gave
me little time to look, for clapping his rifle to his
shoulder he seemed to take a haphazard shot into
the thick of it, and let fly. Then there followed a
louder snorting, with the rending of more bushes
in hurried flight, and at last I had a glimpse of
three dark forms tearing through the covert. One
seemed much larger than the others, and at him I
fired. To my own astonishment, for the shot was
a very hurried one, he lurched forward, evidently
hard hit; but he instantly recovered and went on.
I had a faint idea that some one was calling me
back, telling me that I ought not to follow a
wounded boar in thick covert; but as my hackles
were now fairly up, I crept and ran as well as I
could after my wounded game. The other two
guns made for various rides to cut off any of the
three boars that might come their way. Once or
twice I viewed my beast for a moment, but never
well enough to fire in my cramped position.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the forester had been making what
he called music on his everlasting horn, and some
of his hounds hearing it were soon on the track of
the game. Hot, breathless, and almost in the dark,
among the nearly impenetrable thickets, I was on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the point of giving up the chase when I heard the
dogs baying something not far ahead of me. To
creep to within thirty yards or so of them did not
take long, and then crouching behind the bole of a
huge oak, I waited for my eyes to get used to the
darkness. Gradually I began to make out the
dogs’ sterns waving eagerly to and fro, and then
under a leaning tree-stump, in the very heart of the
shadow, the indistinct outline of their enemy. The
music all this time was maddening. The dogs’
clamour never ceased. The boar kept half growling,
half grunting, while through it all in the
distance came the tootle of our forester’s horn.
Suddenly the mass moved, and a dog went flying
belly uppermost, and his yells were added to the
discord. But this movement of the boar’s was
fatal to him, as it brought him into a more open
position; and seizing the opportunity, I rolled him
over with my ‘express.’ Rising he tried to charge,
but though I fired again, I believe it was unnecessary,
as he was too hard hit ever to have reached
me; still I had seen a man killed by a wounded
boar, and I naturally preferred to keep this one at
a distance.</p>

<p>This was the first really large game I had
killed, and I rushed up to him and gloated over
him with all the abandon of a boy. I have said I
had seen a man killed by a boar, but I should
have added it was his dead body and not the event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
which I saw. Moreover, I had never seen a wild
boar before this morning, and now as I contemplated
my fallen foe a strange uneasiness beset me.
There was something so homely in the innocent
face of that dead pig, that my heart for a moment
misgave me. But I banished these foolish qualms,
the reaction after my triumph probably; and as I
heard the tootle of my friend’s horn approach I
sat myself down on a broad side of bacon and
indulged in a victorious whoo-oop. And now the
bushes part asunder, and R., taking in the position
at a glance, bursts into a cheer and loads me with
praise. But, alas! what is this? As my friend
approaches, slowly the gay smile fades, the applauding
voice is still; the horn drops from his
nerveless grasp, and the merry little visage
lengthens out in a telescopic fashion truly awful
to behold. ‘Moe domaschne kabân!’ Those were
the fatal words that first left his erst joyous
lips&mdash;‘My own house pig!’</p>

<p>The blow was too awful, too sudden. In my
pride I fell. Gradually the fact was borne in on
my already half-awakened mind: ‘wild boars are
black, but this beast was white.’ I had come some
thousand miles to slay a beast which I might have
found in any sty at home; I had accepted my
friend’s hospitality, and rewarded it by slaying his
one cherished porker. How I smoothed him down
I don’t know, but I did it somehow. As for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
myself, I never quite recovered until I had slain
a veritable wild boar long afterwards. The fact
was, this wretched animal had broken out of his
sty some months previously, and betaken himself
to the forest to take his fill of love, chestnuts, and
other pleasant things. He had apparently been
making too free with the lady friends of his black-skinned
brethren, and at the moment at which we
arrived was doing battle with two of them for his
offences. In the dark his own master had not
recognised him, so that there was ample excuse
for me, and there was even a good side to this
mishap, inasmuch as we were all getting very
tired of roe-deer’s flesh, and this forest-fed bacon
was a grateful change. Dragging him home with
a sapling affixed to his snout, was the poorest part
of the joke.</p>

<p>During the next day I did not recover my
spirits sufficiently to try for big game, so the
German colonel and myself devoted it to pheasant-shooting.
The covert consists of thick reed-beds,
the birds are of the original stock from which our
English birds are derived, and in no way differ from
them in size or appearance. We killed very few, my
dog proving utterly useless in thick covert, in
consequence of which I gave her away on the first
opportunity. I had no right of course to expect
that she as a pointer would be useful in covert, so as
the quails had gone and I should have very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
open shooting for some time, I thought it better to
part with her. I am told that throughout the Kuban
district, the tremendous frost of 1876, together with
the floods of the same year, destroyed most of the
pheasants. They certainly seemed scarcer than
they were during my previous visit.</p>

<p>At night, sitting up for big game, I saw a few
woodcock flitting bat-like across the rides, but let
them alone for fear of disturbing better game.
The night was lovely; the fleecy white clouds,
floating through the network of dark branches,
produced a most charming effect. Of all the bird-mimics
I ever met, commend me to the owls
you meet with here. At one moment they bark
like a fox; at another, yell like an evil-minded
infant; at another, you hear them grunting like
swine, and creep on noiseless feet towards the spot,
rifle ready in hand; and then the wretches shriek
out in eldritch laughter at your mistake, and flap
clumsily off to repeat the trick further on.</p>

<p>My last day in the Red Forest was spent in an
‘ablouva’ (drive), which, being utterly mismanaged,
resulted in nothing but a wild cat and a few hares.
In the evening the German colonel and myself had
a very hot discussion about the habits of the
pheasants. He apparently had shot both the
ordinary and the silver pheasant in different parts
of Asia, and stoutly maintained that the pheasant
never roosted on a tree or bush, but invariably on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the ground. My own assertion that with us the
pheasant roosts in trees as a rule, and seldom, if
ever, on the ground, was ridiculed by both the
German and the forester, which, as both appeared
to be fairly keen observers, would lead one to believe
that the perching of our pheasants is an acquired
habit, and not common to their wild congeners.</p>

<p>As we wended our way homeward, we heard
in front of us the bells of a troika, and on the
bridge we overtook it. The horses were stopped,
and a volley of Russian salutations, in a voice
that might have shaken the clouds, greeted us,
while slowly from the folds of a dozen or more
wraps, a grim, gaunt figure of an old Cossack
colonel, about 6 feet 3 inches in length, unrolled
itself. The old gentleman was vociferous to a
degree, and much given to kissing and bebrothering
his friends. Having hugged the forester several
times, almost shaken my arm out of its socket,
and given a multitude of directions to the driver,
whom he addressed alternately as ‘son of a dog’
and ‘little dove,’ he unearthed a quart bottle of
vodka, and patting it fondly, conveyed it to the
forester’s hut, there to give his host a drink, and
tell us all about himself. Although very red-faced
and very grey-haired, this veteran was about as
fine a Cossack as any I ever saw, with the boisterous
manners of an English schoolboy, added
to the peculiarities natural to a Russian. In about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
ten minutes he had put me through the usual
catechism, to which time and experience had
taught me to submit with the greatest placidity.
Who was my father? What was my trade?
Was I rich? Married? Why did I come here,
&amp;c.? To all these questions I had regular stereotyped
answers. But when to the last I answered
that my only object was to kill big game, the old
gentleman’s interest considerably increased. He,
too, was a sportsman, and knew the Caucasus
better than any man living, having spent his
whole life in fighting in it. At this very moment
he was on his way to an estate of his, three days’
journey from the Red Forest, on the Black Sea
coast, where bears and boars (if one were to
believe him) were so numerous as to seriously
impede one’s movements. Would I come with
him and see for myself? Naturally, as an Englishman
I imagined little was meant by such an
off-hand invitation as this; but to my surprise
the forester backed up his suggestion, assuring me
that if I did not assent I should miss a chance I
might never get again. Only half credulous, and
never expecting it would come to anything, I
assented, and, before I well knew where I was, my
things were bundled into the tarantasse, myself
after them, the old Cossack on top of all, the
farewells said, and I was under way again for
Ekaterinodar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>The days of preparation passed in Ekaterinodar
had in them nothing worth recording; I gave up
my portmanteau finally and for ever as too large
to travel through the mountains on horseback, and
bought myself instead some Tscherkess saddle-bags,
in which I stowed three flannel shirts and a few
other things. My gun, too, I was obliged to leave
behind, and thus on the morning of our departure
my entire kit had been reduced to a rifle and small
saddle-bags, half full of cartridges and gunning
implements. We were to have one other travelling
companion, an excessively corpulent cavalry officer;
and if I had little luggage, this worthy made
amends for my deficiencies. Pillows innumerable,
bags and food enough to last through a campaign,
while, as to bottles, I really began to think he
must be starting as a peddling wine or vodka
merchant. All this, as well as our three selves,
had to be piled on one fourgon, or four-wheeled
open cart, and when all the luggage had been
stacked on it, and our hapless selves perched on
top, we presented a picture of about as unlikely a
group to travel far without falling out by the way
as could be readily imagined. The old Cossack
got wedged between two of the largest packages,
and was thus pretty safe, but the ‘plunger’ and
myself, sitting each on some shifting packages of
loaves, sardine-tins, or what not, had an exceedingly
merry time of it. Briskly our horses trotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
along in the keen morning air; the roads were
hard with frost, and as the heavy cart lurched
from rut to rut, and bounded from hole to hole,
we two resembled nothing so much as a pair of
erratic human shuttlecocks. As luck would have
it, both of us returned from our aërial flights in
time to go on with the cart, but at what an expense
of finger-nails and other bruises none but
ourselves can tell. As for the ‘plunger,’ the
exercise acted on him like a rough sea passage,
and before long he was grievously ill, and I
frankly admit that in another hour I should have
been as bad.</p>

<p>The road on leaving Ekaterinodar runs through
marshes, and has been raised and constructed by
Government engineers, who receive a regular
subsidy to keep it in repair. With the money
they apparently do what they like. The governor
has not heard of the state of the road, or having
heard does not interfere; the result is that it is so
infamous that passengers prefer a mere track at
the side to the engineers’ road, which is practically
unused. And this seems to me to be the universal
way of doing things out here. The Government
seems liberal enough, and anxious to promote the
people’s welfare; more than that, considerable
sums of money are expended to this end, but
owing to the vastness of the territory, difficulty of
transit, and want of trustworthiness in its agents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the good intentions of the Government are too
frequently frustrated.</p>

<p>Never was I more heartily thankful than when
we came to what was (for us) the end of this execrable
road; and when at the Tscherkess village of
Enem we saw our horses waiting for us, I felt
almost content with the instruments of torture which
Cossacks call saddles upon their backs. The ‘aoul’
(village) was fenced about with wattled walls,
and seemed a busy, thriving little place, but as far
as I could see contained none of those lovely
women of whom one has heard so much in ‘Lalla
Rookh’ and elsewhere. And perhaps I may be
permitted to say here that neither at Tiflis nor in
Daghestan, nor elsewhere in the Caucasus, have I
seen, either among the peasants or the upper classes,
one single face sufficiently beautiful to attract a
second glance in London. I had heard so much of
Georgian beauty that, like the aurochs, it was one
of the things I had come to look for, and, like the
aurochs, I never found it. I have brought back
several photographs of typical Caucasian faces,
bought at various photographers, who seem to me
to have always chosen the best-looking people they
could find, yet even so they are by no means
strikingly beautiful. The men, if you will, are
many of them magnificent, and as handsome as
they are well built; but for the women, even
those who have good features are so totally devoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
of expression, so extremely animal in their appearance,
as to almost warrant the Turks’ conclusion
that they possess none but physical properties, and
are as soulless as they are insipid. Moreover,
they are most of them so wonderfully alike that
cases of mistaken identity must be common, even
with the most devoted husbands.</p>

<p>By the way, Tscherkess and Cossack are frequently
used amongst the Russians as terms of
reproach, equivalent to robber and swashbuckler
respectively, and no Circassian ever calls himself
Tscherkess.</p>

<p>Here at Enem I got the first insight into my
companions’ ideas of travelling. We had perhaps
been on the road a couple of hours, and had breakfasted
as heartily as men can do, yet here we were
doomed to repeat the process. And to save further
reference to it I may say that our vast supply of
stores was by no means unnecessary. Every two
hours throughout those three days we had a grand
feed, while in the intervals the ‘plunger’ nibbled
and nipped, the Cossack only nipping and smoking
perpetually. If these fellows require as much
food campaigning as they do travelling, they must
be a difficult lot to provide for.</p>

<p>At Enem we hoisted ourselves into our Tartar
or Cossack saddles, things in which you sit as it
were in a narrow deep valley between two gables,
your feet thrust into things like a couple of fire-shovels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
with the corners of which you poke up
the ribs of your Rosinante if he is tired or sluggish.
Here, too, the English equestrian meets with a
novelty in the pace of his horse, which has been
taught to go at a kind of amble called ‘enokod,’ at
which pace the beast travels about twelve miles an
hour with very little fatigue to the rider. Very
few of the horses trot properly, and if they do, and
you attempt to rise to the trot as men do in England,
you meet with so much banter that you are
inclined to wish that they did not. The horses
are for the most part small, and possessed of wonderful
endurance, but there is one breed of horses
in the Caucasus that looks all over like making
into good hunters&mdash;I mean the Khabardine. They
are larger, finer, and faster animals than any
others that I have ever seen in Russia, and their
price is proportionately higher. A good Khabardine
costs from 200 to 500 roubles.</p>

<p>As we journeyed on from Enem the country
became more hilly and more wooded, and at every
turn we encountered the pretty little trout stream
Pscekupz. How often we crossed that stream
before we reached the sea I should be afraid to
guess, but it seemed to me that we were almost
as often in the water as out of it, and it is this
small stream that when flooded stops this road to
the Black Sea for nearly half the year. We
stayed for the night at some mineral springs about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
forty versts from Enem, beautifully situated near
the Pscekupz, with high, well-timbered hills all
round. Most of the trees are young oaks, which
were now lovely in their russet robes. But there
are, besides, wild pear and apple, with everywhere
a thick undergrowth of hazel. At the mineral
springs is a Russian military hospital, and the
doctor in charge was our host for the night. The
hospital is built to hold some 300 people, and it
was believed that this place would in time become
a fashionable bathing-place for the Caucasus.
Hitherto, however, the military have had it all to
themselves. There are a few good houses in the
place, and Government is erecting baths over
the springs. The springs themselves are of hot
water, strongly impregnated with sulphur, which
comes down from the hills at a temperature of 42°
Reaumur. I saw some of the water, which was
colder, of a dull bluish grey, and stank horribly.
These baths are supposed to cure rheumatic affections,
and my friend the Cossack pretended to
have obtained great relief from them. Nay, so
enthusiastic was he that, after taking them both
internally and externally, he insisted on my doing
the same. Being in extreme need of a tub, I
complied with his whim as far as an external application
went, and was parboiled for my complacency,
feeling a good deal worse when I came
out than I did when I went in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The springs run through a white stone which,
though extremely hard on the surface, pulverises
at the touch the moment the outside layer is
removed. I am myself ignorant of geology, but I
was assured that this was quartz of a very high
quality, and excellently adapted for the manufacture
of glass. If this be so, a glass factory
here would, one would imagine, be an extremely
remunerative speculation, with any quantity of
timber and water-power immediately at hand,
and no rival factory nearer than Moscow, especially
as glass is in the Caucasus a very dear
commodity, bad glass bottles costing from ten to
fifteen copecks. In the evening and in the morning
we saw the worst side of the village by the
springs; for on both occasions a dense white fog
rolled up from the valley high up the hills, completely
hiding them from view, while the dew
lay on the grass like rain after a very severe
thunder shower.</p>

<p>We left the springs early, and shivered in our
saddles as we waded through the rolling fog
clouds, although in a few hours’ time the heat
was quite oppressive.</p>

<p>I noticed to-day by the wayside a large quantity
of mistletoe, and have since remarked that its abundance
is not restricted to this one part of the Caucasus.
The insects by the wayside were ‘hyale,’
clouded yellow, red admirals, painted ladies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
several varieties of white butterflies. I also
noticed some large pale yellow butterflies, which
may have been the common brimstone, but I
believe were not. I am pretty sure too that I
recognised one ‘comma.’ We passed through one
or two villages inhabited by ‘plastoons’ (Russian
settlers), who in spite of the richness of the soil appeared
to be in the most abject poverty. On every
face the fever had set its yellow seal, and all the
women over forty were hideous enough to frighten
Macbeth’s witches.</p>

<p>Truly, this Caucasus must be the land of the
lotus-eaters, yet what sorry beings these lotus-eaters
are. All round them such beauty as Tennyson
has dreamed of; mountains clothed in gold
and purple, with the sea murmuring round their
bases; wealth to be had for the taking, from the
too luxuriant soil; and yet here the peasant smokes
and moons away his life, content to cull in idleness
just enough to keep body and soul together, and
only doing just enough work to provide for himself
a crop of that weed in the consumption of
which he wastes life and energy, as well as the
money and opportunities that might be his. Each
village where Russians lived seemed to me more
wretchedly poor than the last, and it became a
relief to see how few and far between the villages
were. The Tscherkesses, who made a garden of at
least some parts of their native home, might almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
feel revenged in contemplating the utter failure of
the race which has supplanted them.</p>

<p>But for us the day was no day of idleness, but
rather one of considerable toil and difficulty. The
road grew exceeding steep and rugged, and the
little baggage cart which we had endeavoured to
send on by our men came to grief, and was broken
beyond repair. The driver, who was on the top
of the baggage, probably asleep, got a bad fall, and
was rather seriously hurt. The tripod of my
photographic apparatus was broken, and the stock
of my rifle snapped short off at the pistol grip.
The ‘plunger’s’ store of eau-de-Cologne, without
which this hero felt it impossible to travel, was also
lost in the general disaster, and he, poor fellow,
had very bad times throughout the day, having
had too much to eat and too much shaking up
after it. For a cavalry officer, too, it was somewhat
undignified, when ascending one steep little
ravine, to slide off over his horse’s quarters; and for
a man of his weight it must have been as painful
as it was ridiculous. Laughter went a long way
towards leaving me as helpless as he was, for a
more ludicrous sight than our gallant companion
rolling off behind, it would be difficult to conceive.</p>

<p>The night was, if anything, worse than the
day, for my old friend the Cossack, having a great
deal of pain from an old injury near his spine,
determined to cure it with hard drinking; the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of which was that he became helplessly drunk, and
the ‘plunger’ only irritably so. In this condition
the nature of the man showed itself, and he amused
himself by baiting me, a stranger, and his friend’s
guest, for the amusement of his servants. At last
his insolence became so intolerable that, risking all
possible consequences, I got him by the scruff of
the neck and gave him such a shaking as he had
not experienced even during the rough ride of the
last few days. It was, of course, extremely unpleasant
for me, but my host was too drunk to
interfere, and there are some things which a man
cannot stand.</p>

<p>Next morning, after having spent the night
awake in a state of siege, uncertain what my quondam
friend’s servants might think fit to do to me, I
had a wretched ride in my own society to Duapsè,
the little seaport town which was to be the end of
our journey. The ‘plunger’ neither apologised nor
called me out, as I had thought he might, but the
good old Cossack behaved like a gentleman, and
although, of course, we were glad to say good-by to
one another at Duapsè, we parted good friends, and
I believe he exonerated me from all blame in the
matter.</p>

</div>

<p>At Duapsè there is an English (Indo-European)
telegraph station, so, though unexpectedly thrown
on my own resources again, I was much better off
than I might otherwise have been. The Englishmen
gave me a cordial welcome, and were very good to
me. Duapsè, I am informed, is built on a graveyard,
in which are buried numbers of the victims of the
Russo-Tscherkess war. In 1864, after the final
subjugation of the Caucasus, some 200,000 Circassians
left the Caucasus for Trebizond, at the
invitation of their conquerors. They were for the
most part conveyed in small Turkish vessels, in
which they were so crowded, starved, and exposed,
that not more than half ever reached their destination,
the others dying <i>en route</i>. Of these a very large proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
died near Duapsè, and were there landed
and buried, or left to bleach, according to the means
of their friends. Their graves are still marked
by little mounds and inequalities in the ground
throughout the place. On their miserable journey
they sold everything they possessed, and I have
frequently heard in Kertch and in the Caucasus of
girls being sold for a few roubles, and valuable
daggers (the last thing almost that a Tscherkess
parts with) for about the same. Now Duapsè is
a vilely squalid hole, with two telegraph stations
and a governor’s house. The steamers from Odessa
and Poti touch here, if it is fine, once a week, but
if there is any sea on they cannot come in, as I
was hereafter to learn to my cost. Why Duapsè
exists, and still more why it has a governor, I
never could conceive.</p>

<p>It was, then, with a feeling of intense relief
that on October 21 I left Duapsè behind me and
turned my horse’s head southwards along the
Black Sea shore. I had managed to engage a
couple of Russian peasants, Ivan and Yepheem, to
guide me to some happy hunting-grounds of which
they knew, some fifty versts from Duapsè. Taking
three horses, we loaded each with as much provisions
as he could carry, and then climbed on top
ourselves. It was difficult work to so adjust yourself
and baggage, as to keep your seat over the
boulders. Grip was, of course, impossible, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
balance, with a shifting basis under you, almost as
much so.</p>

<p>The road lay between the base of the cliffs
and the sea, and as these two were in close
juxtaposition, your horse had at one time to wade
and at another to creep from boulder to boulder,
in places where even a goat would have to move
with caution. This lasted for fifteen versts, and
these fifteen have in rough weather to be avoided,
and a long circuitous route in the hills substituted
for them. After leaving these stony places, the
road winds up into the hills, and here the eye had
a feast indeed. All the way from Ekaterinodar
the scenery had been beautiful, but here it was
superb. Range upon range of hills, as far as the
eye could see, one behind another, and each range
higher than the last, until far away one caught the
sheen of snow-peaks against the sky. The autumn
foliage was a never-ending glory. One shrub in
particular caught my eye, of stunted growth, with
a long oval leaf, which was now of the most brilliant
shades of red. This shrub grew in immense
clumps, and the effect at a short distance was that
of vast beds of scarlet geranium.</p>

<p>But the road in the hills was almost as bad
as the road by the sea, and after having done some
twenty-eight versts in the whole day, our horses
were done up, and so were we. Just after noon
my men stayed behind for some time, and I, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
nothing of it, rode slowly on. In about half
an hour they rejoined, looking mightily pleased
with themselves, and very drunk. They had discovered
a large bottle holding about three pints
of vodka, which I had brought with me for our use
during the next fortnight. This they had quietly
sat down to the moment my back was turned, and
finished it. It was no good my making a row
about it; I was in their hands, and determined to
bear with them, at least until I found out where
game was to be found, after which I could decide
whether to keep them or try alone. Meanwhile
they had finished their grog, and as I did not
mean to give up mine, they would be punished by
enforced abstinence for some time to come.</p>

<p>A Cossack station in the Caucasus is about as
strange a place to pass the night in as can well be
imagined. Ten or a dozen privates, with the manners
of monkeys in the Zoo, all sleeping in the
same room with yourself and their officer, a youngster
generally little better educated than themselves,
and thoroughly hail-fellow with them all. Such is
your company. Your couch the top of the ‘petchka’
(oven), if you like heat and dirt, and are inclined
to pay for the berth; if not, as much room as you
can get on the floor or on a form, with a Cossack’s
boots next your head and a Cossack’s head next
to your boots. For supper we got some barbel,
and a fish they called ‘golovin,’ which one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
soldiers had caught; and though tired enough to
turn in gladly even here, we were, I think, even
more glad to turn out again at four next morning.</p>

<p>On our way we came across signs of bears;
in the first instance, in the face of a Greek settler we
met, whose nose and mouth had apparently got
discontented with their original positions, and had
altered them according to their own fancy. On
inquiry, we found that two years ago the Greek
had been frightening bears from his orchard, when
one of them had attacked him and, striking him on
the head, peeled the face off his skull almost, and left
him still living in this condition. He was found,
and the face replaced as well as possible, but his
whole appearance was hideously distorted.</p>

<p>A mile or two further on we came across fresh
tracks of a regular family of bears, who had been
down to the high-water line looking for waifs and
strays whilst we were sleeping at the Cossack station.</p>

<p>Mid-day found us at our camping place&mdash;a
ruined datch or villa belonging formerly to General
Heiman, built on an estate given him, I believe,
as a reward for his successes against the aborigines.
But the house was never finished and the land
never reclaimed. Where once the Tscherkess had
magnificent orchards, nothing now remains save
here and there a fruit-tree, still bearing fruit though
sparingly, choked by the luxuriant growth of
forest trees. Through the doorless doorways and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
windowless frames of the ruined villa, the big
trees branch in, creepers and blackberry bushes
grow merrily inside, while from the very hearth,
disturbed by our intrusion, a scared woodcock
bustles away. The spot had evidently been used
as a camping place by drovers before our day, for
all round the white skulls of cattle bleached on the
shore and on the sward, while remains of camp-fires
were numerous, although there were none of
recent date. All this warned us to be careful, so
that our first step, after turning out our horses,
was to secrete all our provisions, &amp;c. in a hole
beneath the flooring, and to destroy, as far as possible,
all traces of our presence.</p>

<p>Having done this, we turned to the greenwood,
and indeed it was not far to go. Two dozen strides,
and we had almost to cut our way through the
dense undergrowth. After a time we forced our
way to more open forest, and here we parted. Not
twenty minutes afterwards there was a report that
set the forest shrieking. Something came crashing
down hill past me, and rumbled away into silence
down a deep tree-covered gorge. In a few minutes
I arrived on the scene of action, and found Ivan
and his mongrel pointer gloating over a fine sow
he had slain. Having gralloched her, we hoisted
her on to the top of a blasted and broken oak,
and, there impaled, she presented to us a ghastly,
and to the jackals who soon arrived a no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
very tantalising, appearance. However, we left
them to their own devices and, feeling sure of pork
chops for dinner, continued our hunt.</p>

<p>Twice I heard swine close to me, and both
my men saw game again during the afternoon;
but the covert was so dense that we none of us
got another shot, and, what was worse, all lost
our way. The sun, which had been our guide,
went down all in a moment, and left us in the
dark without a compass to steer by. For two
hours and a half I struggled through jungle that
tore me to pieces, and threw me down every few
yards. I climbed out of a ravine up the white
face of a cliff, gun in hand, which cliff I inspected
by daylight on another occasion, and
would not climb again for the best day’s shooting
that man ever had; and at last, fagged and
bleeding, came upon Ivan resting, with his pig
up aloft keeping watch for him.</p>

<p>After getting the pig down and finding Yepheem,
we started on the back track; but, though
the track had been comparatively easy by daylight,
with no pig to drag along, we lost it in about
five minutes now. In another ten minutes we
were completely lost, and, realizing the fact, prepared
to meet it. We had, fortunately, between
us two boxes of matches, furnished with which
Yepheem gave us an occasional glimmer of light,
by which Ivan hewed away with his kinjal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
through the tangled creepers, while I plodded
wearily on behind with the pig in tow. Two
hours of this kind of thing, added to the previous
day’s work, was more than I could stand;
so we sat down, made a wood fire, and, by its
light, divided the sow longitudinally.</p>

<p>It was no good waiting for the moon to rise,
as she was in her last quarter; so Yepheem shouldering
one half, and myself the other, we floundered
on again, to arrive at last at the ruin
about midnight, dead beat and starving, to say
nothing of being saturated with the blood of the
pig, and lacerated all over by the thorns of that
abominable creeper the ‘wolf’s tooth.’ Then,
after one long pull at the whiskey bottle, I lay
down and slept where I was, too tired to wait
for the chops which the men were frying by
my side.</p>

<p>Nor were my men much less tired; for when I
woke with a shiver at dawn, one of them was asleep
with his skewer of grilled pork almost untouched
by his side. Of this I speedily relieved him, and,
raking together the embers of the fire, which my
men had made under the flooring the night before, I
re-cooked the kabobs, and breakfasted, not perhaps
sumptuously, but with an appetite that made
amends for any defects in the cooking.</p>

<p>Whilst the men still slept, I went down to
the sea for a swim and a look at the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
round us. Looking from the sea you saw nothing
but endless hills, growing gradually into mountains,
as they receded farther and farther from the
shore. Everywhere they seemed covered with
forest, the greater part of which was composed
of Spanish chestnut trees. Except a solitary
eagle, a few porpoises rolling about near in shore,
and one of my men coming down now to collect
drift-wood, there was no sign of life anywhere.
After helping to light the fire and brew the tea, I
sent Yepheem to look for the horses, which were
nowhere in sight, and meanwhile Ivan and I took
our rifles and tried another part of the forest.
We had gone but a very little way when the
dog gave tongue, and was evidently driving something
through the bushes towards us. Ivan ran
in one direction, I in another, to cut off the
game. Standing behind a big tree at the foot
of a small hill, covered with rhododendron clumps,
I heard a rustling through the covert, such as
some small animal might make if quietly forcing
his way through. I never dreamed it was our
game, but was still intently listening for the crashing
charge I was beginning to know so well.
Looking in the direction of the rustling, I was
thunderstruck to see three magnificent grey old
boars following one another in single file down
hill, straight to my tree. The almost cat-like
noiselessness with which large and clumsy animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
can move about in thick covert, is almost more
wonderful than the tremendous noise even small
ones make when so minded. I picked out the
leading boar, fired, and with a thundering rush
they were gone. How I could have missed him
I don’t know, but I apparently did clean, and
for the rest of that day I found it harder than
ever not to speak somewhat unadvisedly with
my lips when a long loop of ‘wolf’s tooth’ caught
me up under the nose, or a hazel wand flew back
and cut me over the ear.</p>

<p>Later on in the afternoon we were all three
walking abreast, with perhaps a hundred yards
between each gun, when I caught a glimpse of
Ivan stealthily scrambling up an old stump, from
which elevated position he aimed carefully, for
what seemed about five minutes, at something
almost under his feet. Then followed the click
that denotes a missfire, and a great crashing
amidst the rhododendron bushes, as a big brown
bear scuttled away in undignified flight. Some
minutes afterwards, whilst Ivan with many curses
was descending from the stump, his valuable piece
went off, luckily damaging no one.</p>

<p>Except some wild boars seen by Yepheem, this
was the last game we saw during the day, although
we came across regular roads made by bears and
swine, and one patch of several acres, which from
the broken fruit-trees and trampled state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
ground appeared to be a regular bear den. The
quantity of fruit one meets with in these Circassian
forests compensates in some measure for persecutions
of the ‘wolf’s tooth’ and other thorny
creepers. Large apples, walnuts, grapes, ‘fourmar’
(an edible berry for which I do not know any other
name), medlars, blackberries, dewberries, and a
kind of scarlet plum, occur frequently, and whereever
they occur the trees are smashed into ruins
by the bears. You begin to get some notion of
the power of a bear when you have seen the enormous
boughs he has broken in his greed for fruit.
To-night the jackals were calling all round us, but
the wily little beasts never gave me a shot.</p>

<p>In the morning Yepheem woke us with the
pleasant intelligence that our horses had been
stolen. A drover had passed along the coast
whilst we were shooting the day before, and
suspicion immediately settled on his party. Of
course after this news there was no hunting for us
to-day, for while Ivan and Yepheem scoured the
country for our missing steeds, I had to sit at home
and watch. At nightfall the best news they could
give me was that the Cossacks on the station at
which we had slept on our way hither had lost six
of their horses at the same time.</p>

<p>I had time during the day to examine the insect
life about our camp, and amongst the butterflies I
noticed all three meadow browns, quantities of very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
large brimstones, a fritillary, and a wood argus,
whilst amongst the moths I recognized quantities
of the gamma and the humming-bird hawk moth.</p>

<p>When we went down to the shore to bathe,
huge shoals of what looked like bass were playing
close in shore, but alas we had no means of securing
any, though they would have been a noble addition
to our ill-found larder.</p>

<p>Last night, whilst writing up my journal, with
my legs dangling from a rafter, and a great wood
fire burning by my side, by which the men lay
curled in their bourkas, the wind that came moaning
through the open places in the wall brought
with it a sound between a child’s wail and a wolf’s
howl, which was so distinct from the jackals’ cries
that it arrested my attention at once. The men
sprang to their feet simultaneously, and with excited
faces whispered ‘barse’ (panther). At our
backs was the ruined doorway through which
the forest trees stretched their arms; in our front
was the huge empty window place with thickets
of briar and thorn half blinding it, and right
under it the sound seemed. For a moment I
believe the same feeling was on all of us, that the
next event would be the entrance of our serenader
by either door or window. However, this wore off
at once, and snatching up my rifle I crept to the
window place to try to make out the beast in the
moonlight. But outside all was a maze of shadowy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
limbs and dark places, with every here and there a
brilliant patchwork of moonshine; and though I
went outside and carefully beat all round our camp
I could not catch sight of the barse.</p>

<p>To-night, having had a lazy day in camp, I
was by no means in a hurry to roll myself up in the
least draughty corner, so taking my rifle, having
constructed a night sight for it, I betook myself to
the beach to await our last night’s visitor should he
repeat his visit.</p>

<p>The hills near Heiman’s Datch come down almost
to the high-water line, so that sitting hidden under
some drift-wood I had the forest close at my back,
and a little above me; so close indeed as to suggest
the possibility of a sudden spring from the bushes
to my hiding place if any beast had the courage to
try it. Before me lay some forty yards at most of
strand, and beyond a perfectly calm and silent sea.
Far up in one of the valleys at my back two
wolves were answering each other, and away towards
Duapsè I could hear some jackals fighting
over some carrion they had found.</p>

<p>But for a long time nothing happened, except
every now and then a rustle in the forest at my
back, that made me start and bring my gun to bear
on its dark fastnesses. I had almost made up my
mind to give up my watch and return to the ruin,
when a figure like the grey ghost of some large
hound was just visible against the sky line. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
too dark to see even the barrels of my rifle, but
aiming as best I could, I fired. The figure bounded
forward and trotted briskly along the coast from
me; so pitching my rifle low, and well in front, I
fired again. Then the beast vanished. For a
minute or two I waited, expecting to see it again,
or at least hear it making off, and then, loading my
rifle, I went up to the spot at which I had last seen
it. But whatever the beast was, it had vanished,
and feeling that I had wasted a couple of hours
and a couple of cartridges in missing a jackal, I
went back to my roost in the ruin.</p>

<p>However, on the morning after my night-watch,
when we went down to bathe and collect drift-wood
for our fires, my man Ivan suddenly called
to me to look at something he had found on the
stones. On inspection it proved to be large blood
drops, on the very spot, as near as I could tell, on
which my shadowy visitor of the night before had
stood. Following the blood track along the shore,
we momentarily expected to find a dead jackal, as,
from the quantity of blood, the beast must have
been very hard hit. Some two hundred yards
along the shore the trail crossed the mouth of a
little mountain stream, with a bed of soft clay on
one side of it, and through this the trail went.
Our astonishment may be imagined when along
with the blood marks we found the fresh tracks of
a large panther (or more properly leopard), which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
had evidently been the beast wounded by me in
the dark the night before. Of course the search
was now prosecuted with far greater ardour, at
least on my part. As for the men, they have so
many yarns about the much dreaded barse, that
they were not as keen as they might have been;
and when the trail turned from the shore and
entered some extremely dense and dark thickets,
they came to a stand, and nothing would induce
them to enter the forest with me. Unfortunately
the dog was of their mind, so that after wandering
blindly about for some time, tearing myself to
pieces, and losing my temper terribly, I had to
give up my search, with the conviction strong
upon me that a noble and (in this part of the
world) rare quarry was lying dead within a stone’s
throw of me.</p>

<p>‘Barse’ is the name given by the peasants on
the Black Sea coast, and in fact generally throughout
the Caucasus, to any feline animal larger than
a wild cat; and this indiscriminate use of the word
occasioned me a good deal of trouble. Too often
when they tell you of barse, the animal they refer
to is only the lynx, of which there are at least
two varieties in the Caucasus, and which is extremely
numerous on some parts of the Black Sea
coast. The natives trap it for its skin, which is one
of the commonest in the furriers’ shops of Tiflis
and Ekaterinodar. But that the leopard or ocelot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
(the snow leopard of India) does occur not uncommonly
in the Caucasus, even on its western coast,
I was assured by Professor Radde, the courteous
director of the Tiflis Museum, who showed me
great kindness in going over his collections with
me during my stay in that town. And even had I
had no further confirmation than the tracks I have
above alluded to, I should feel convinced that the
beast I wounded was an unmistakable leopard.</p>

<p>Returning from our tracking operations, we
were startled by seeing a strange figure moving
about inside our camp, evidently looking for anything
light enough to carry away. Remembering
our horses, we never for a moment doubted but
that this was one of the gentry who had stolen
them, returned possibly for the saddles. Had he
been, he would have had fleet feet to have escaped,
for we went for him like terriers for a rat. But our
anger was turned to rejoicing when we recognised
the face of a friendly Cossack from the next station,
who had brought our horses back with him, and
was looking for nothing more valuable than a
still smouldering ember to light his cigarette by.
Our horses had joined his ‘taboon’ (herd), which
had been pasturing in a valley somewhere between
our camp and his station, and he had there found
them the night before.</p>

<p>On hearing this good news Ivan and his chum
announced to my disgust their intention of going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
straight back to Duapsè, before any further accidents
happened, alleging as their reasons that their
wives could not do without them any longer. As
a matter of fact, I presume their own appetite for
sport was satiated, and their appetite for vodka
becoming daily more unendurably keen. As no
words or promises of mine could turn them from
their resolve I gave in to them, merely stipulating
that they should leave me one of their horses to
take me twelve versts further up the coast, to the
hut of a Tscherkess telegraph watcher, who lived by
that irrepressible mountain torrent the Golovinsk.
To this they agreed, and I moreover managed to
persuade the Cossack to accompany me to Golovinsky,
as another Cossack station at which he
could rest was not far from the watcher’s hut. So
we parted company, my men and I, and I don’t
think I suffered any great loss from their defection.
My reasons for wishing to go to Golovinsky were,
that a report had come down the coast that in the
extensive chestnut forest round the watcher’s hut
bears were more than usually numerous, the man
himself having recently killed two by shooting from
a platform in a tree during the night.</p>

<p>The Cossack and myself, having seen the two Russians
round the first little promontory, unearthed
a small quantity of whiskey which I had managed
to save from their insatiable thirst, and with this
and a pork kabob made a very fair lunch, and laid
the foundation of a good understanding between
us. Then we piled up a pyramid of odds and
ends on the back of each little horse, and made the
whole fast with cords. The equestrians’ enviable
position was astride the summit of the pyramid of
luggage&mdash;a position difficult to retain when gained,
and almost impossible to attain unaided. However,
after many failures the Cossack hoisted me on
to my place, and providing we never went out of
a walk I felt fairly safe. How the Cossack got up
was a miracle, but he did it somehow; and we
proceeded at a walk through the shingle, that forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the only possible pathway along this part of the
shore.</p>

<p>We had not gone far when it seemed to me
that I was gradually leaning over more and more
towards the sea. I tried to regain an erect position,
and then I became aware of my situation.
My girths had got slack, and my saddle, with its
huge pile of luggage, of which I was the highest
point, was gradually turning round under my
horse’s belly. Seated as I was, I was utterly helpless;
I could not readjust my saddle, and a voluntary
descent, except head first, was impossible. So I
waited the course of events, and in a few moments
lay sprawling on the ground, half buried in pots
and pans, bourkas, and other impedimenta.</p>

<p>This was our only misadventure, however,
and about four o’clock we came in sight of the
watcher’s hut&mdash;a two-roomed wooden shanty,
knocked up in the roughest way possible, standing
on the edge of the shingle, with a big brown bear-skin
stretched over the roof to dry. A more utterly
miserable-looking hut cannot well be conceived;
but the skin on the thatch consoled me, proclaiming
as it did the vicinity of the game I was in
search of.</p>

<p>After much shouting and hammering at the
board that constituted the hut’s one door, a wild
Robinson Crusoe-like fellow came shuffling out.
Tall and well built, but taciturn and clumsy to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
degree, Stepan was not a favourable specimen of
the benefits of woodland isolation to mankind.
Instead of giving me a kindly welcome as, to do
them justice, all Russian peasants had hitherto
done, he eyed me in the doubtful manner in which
some big dog might eye a too familiar stranger
before snapping at the would-be caressing hand.
His face was shrivelled and yellow with fever, and
a frequent deep cough formed no pleasant accompaniment
to our cottage life. Gradually his
sullenness gave way to surprise at the presence of
an English gentleman in those evil places, for such
he evidently deemed Golovinsky; and when I explained
to him that I wished to hire his services
and the use of his hut, as well as to put all game
killed at his disposal, his delight knew no bounds.
His terms were a rouble a week, that is about
half a crown; but that seemed so unfair to me that
I trebled it, and added to it a promise of ten
roubles additional for the skinning of the first
bear I should kill; and considering that he gave
me house-room, black bread, and his whole time,
I think 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week was not an exorbitant
charge.</p>

<p>However, he was delighted, and though rather
startled to find that his whole larder consisted of
some black bread, onions, and pork fat (‘salo’),
I consoled myself with the reflection that with the
addition of tea and sugar, which I had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
with me, we should be able to hold out for a week
at least, in which time I should probably have
obtained my coveted bear-skin.</p>

<p>Outside the hut all was beauty. The hut itself
was as nearly as possible the centre of a bay of
fairly high hills, enclosing a couple of hundred
acres or so of plain covered with low shrubs.
Beyond the first chain of hills, which was wooded
to the top, rose another and a higher chain, and
so one after another, in successive semicircles, they
rose range above range, until far away in the
sapphire sky shone the white glory of the snow-peaks.
Out at sea a long line of pelicans lay
tossing on the little waves, like a small fleet riding
at anchor. Within the hut all was squalor and
filth. The place consisted of two rooms, in one
of which was a telegraphic apparatus of the
simplest kind, with a handle like that of a barrel
organ, and a face like the face of a clock with
letters in place of numerals. This was the deity
of the place and Stepan’s pride and fear. Near it
was a camp bedstead, and here the list of the
furniture ends. The other room was merely a
shed, in which such cooking as we had to do was
done; and though the appliances were of the
simplest, we never taxed them overmuch. The
floors throughout were of mud, and several inches
deep in refuse, dating from the time of Stepan’s
arrival in his den.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Borrowing a spade and cutting down a large
bough for a broom, I soon had a clear floor, and
by dint of hard work had in an hour’s time got
a fairly clean place to move about in. Stepan
retired to the shed, and, in spite of my protestations,
took up his abode there. Had it not been
for his cough I should have fallen in with this
arrangement readily enough; but as it was, I felt
he required the best accommodation the shanty
afforded. However, in the shed he remained, and
for the rest of my stay I had his best room to
myself.</p>

<p>There were, besides Stepan and myself, three
other residents at the ‘telegraph station,’ as he
loved to call it&mdash;to wit, Zizda, Lufra, and Orla,
three large cross-bred dogs, devoured by mange,
with which Stepan hunts the boars that abound in
the thicket at the back of his house, killing on an
average, so he tells me, half a dozen in the year.
In spite of the numbers which inhabit the adjoining
forests, this small bag is not very much to be
wondered at, when the impenetrable nature of the
covert and the almost utter uselessness of Stepan’s
gun are taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Russian peasants have amongst them the most
wonderful fire-arms in the world, which, as a rule,
they buy in the bazaars at from three to five
roubles (<i>i.e.</i> 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) each. I have
frequently seen the grebe-shooters along the shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
at Kertch using old rifle-barrels worn thin, tied on
to a rough stock, with flint lock, &amp;c., the whole
thing being compounded of the remains of some
venerable weapon in use in the Russian army
immediately after the invention of gunpowder.
Stepan’s was no exception to this rule, and yet
I distinctly remember seeing him put in charges
which I would not have ventured to put into my
high-class breech-loader.</p>

<p>After putting the house in order, Stepan loaded
his valuable weapon with a good charge of powder
and two bullets, the first in its naturally smooth
state, the other chewed into a rough-edged mass.
Thus prepared we sallied forth and reconnoitred
the little plain within the hills. Everywhere the
tracks of bears, boars, wolves, and occasionally roe-deer
presented themselves to our eyes, but of the
animals themselves we saw nothing. Pheasants
rose several times from the bushes at our feet, and
Stepan tells me Golovinsky is a favourite abiding
place of theirs, in consequence of the quantity
of ‘phaisantchik’ growing here, upon the
yellow berry of which they feed. The pheasants
have no bad taste in berries, for when ripe I
know no berry much pleasanter in flavour than
that of the ‘phaisantchik,’ in spite of its acidity.
The flavour strongly resembles that of the pineapple.</p>

<p>Of course, as pheasants abound here, Stepan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
has no fowling-piece, and I have left mine behind
at Ekaterinodar. You would imagine that living
as the Cossacks, Stepan and many others, do, in a
state of semi-starvation in the matter of meat from
week to week, with an abundance of game birds
round them, they would become good shots and
keen sportsmen, or at the very least turn trappers,
and so supply themselves with food. And yet it
is not so. Not one Cossack amongst the many I
have met was a sportsman, and this perhaps their
want of sporting rifles and ammunition may account
for; though, if they were allowed to use them, no
better rifle than the Berdianka, with which they are
supplied, could be desired. But that neither they,
nor the settlers and peasants, should have any idea
of trapping, is most strange. In all the Crimea and
Caucasus I never saw or heard of snare, or pitfall, or
any of the hundred and one devices for killing game
without fire-arms, which other nations use. The
only thing of the kind I ever heard of, was told me
by a German settler, who assured me that in some
places they caught pheasants by inserting small
cones of paper, limed inside, into the earth; in the
bottom of each cone a pea is placed and others
strewn around. The pheasant, after finishing the
peas scattered on the surface of the ground, finds
the pea at the bottom of the cone, and, in trying to
peck it out, hoodwinks himself with the limed paper
cone, and being blinded becomes frightened, and remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
cowering on the ground, an easy prey to the
trapper. But I could never hear of any one amongst
the Tscherkesses, Cossacks, or ‘plastoons’ (settlers),
who had either done this or heard of its being done;
and I believe I am right in saying that the Russians,
at least in the Crimea and Caucasus, know
very little of trapping, and indeed of woodcraft
generally.</p>

<p>I had passed the first part of this my first night
at Golovinsky, sleeping as well as I could in my
only too well ventilated quarters; and rising while
it was still dark, Stepan and I had wiled away the
time in chatting of the snares and traps with which
different nations used to kill their game. As we
chatted he busied himself on a pair of rough sandals
or mocassins he was making for me from the skin
of a wild boar he had killed in the spring. As
soon as they were finished, he steeped them in
water to soften them, and then, first wrapping my
leg round with canvas, he fastened on the sandals,
winding the long laces round and round the canvas
until they fastened just below the knee. Thus I
was booted and gaitered <i>à la mode Circassienne</i> in
a very short time; and as the dawn slowly broke
over the mountains, and the stars grew pale and
died in the grey of morning, we left our hut and
walked hard to warm ourselves in the soft rain that
began with dawn.</p>

<p>On our way to the forest, which began at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
foot of the first range of hills, we had to ford that
turbulent trout stream, the Golovinsk, and as its
waters come straight down from the higher peaks,
and are fed almost entirely by melted snow, right
bitterly cold we found it. Chilled and wet to the
waist, we forced our way through a weary half
hour’s work in thorn brake and strangling creeper,
while the gathered rain-drops ran in streams down
our necks and up our sleeves from every bough we
touched.</p>

<p>At last we gained the more open chestnut forest,
and here we found how great a boon the rain really
was to us. The leaves, which the day before had
sounded like small minute-guns under our feet,
firing a warning to every beast in the forest, were
now soft and silent. Arrived among the chestnuts,
Stepan and I separated, he taking a line along the
base of the hill, I choosing a parallel line much
higher up. To-day the dogs had been tied
up, and our <i>modus operandi</i> was simply to
walk as silently as possible through the forest,
stopping every twelve yards or so to listen, and
trusting at least as much to our ears as to our eyes
to find the game.</p>

<p>For over an hour I stalked noiselessly on, hearing
nothing but the rattle of the falling chestnuts,
the patter of the ceaseless rain, and the screaming
of the everlasting jays. It is easy to understand
why the Indian, whose whole life is spent more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
less in the chase, becomes such a silent, self-contained
being. The whole chase is a school for
silence and self-restraint. Should you tread carelessly,
a twig breaks and your chance is lost;
should a thorn run right up under your nail from
end to end, you must not complain; and should the
bitter blows dealt you in the face by the rebounding
twigs, or the tearing and strangling of the
thorny creepers, at last extract an exclamation, your
chance is over for the day.</p>

<p>For over an hour I bore all the malice of the
forest fiend silently and uncomplainingly. But at
last, in an evil moment, a long trailing loop of
thorny vine hooked me under the nose, and pulling
up that tender member to an unusual angle, held
it firmly hooked in its painful position. Then I
fear the wrath within me boiled over; and as I released
my mutilated proboscis, I spoke unadvisedly
with my tongue. Hardly was the imprecation out of
my lips when there was a short sharp snort, and a
black object flashed past me downhill at a hundred
miles an hour. A quick snap-shot failed to stop
him, and so I passed on, reflecting that my little
explosion had cost me probably the only game I
was doomed to see that day.</p>

<p>But this lesson taught me caution, and a short
half-hour afterwards, whilst I was creeping noiselessly
along a kind of natural cutting, I was suddenly
aware of a big black thing moving in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
hazels high above me. The creature looked as if
it was browsing, and might have been anything
from a cow to a rhinoceros, for any distinguishing
feature that I could discern. However, in such a
position, I argued, it must be game of some sort,
so, raising my rifle, I aimed as nearly as possible
into the middle of it, and fired. The yells that
followed my shot were proof positive that I had hit
something, and before I had time to turn, an old
bear was coming straight down to me through the
brushwood, ‘puffing’ furiously as he came, like
an excited locomotive engine. I had time to notice
that his mode of progression was curious and lopsided,
lurching as he did on to his hams at every
step, and when he was almost on top of me, rolling
over the cutting in which I stood: only avoiding
me by a few yards, he went crashing downhill,
taking another bullet with him as he went, and
lodging under a fallen tree far down the hillside.</p>

<p>Here for a time I left him, making the woods
hideous with his snarling and moaning; and after
some ten minutes’ shouting I managed to get my
guide, Stepan, to come to me, white and shaking
with fright. He explained to me that he thought
I had been certainly killed, and in consequence of
this, I suppose, believed I should want his services
no more. Standing in the cutting, I pointed out
to him the place where Bruin lay, far down through
an almost impenetrable thicket of blackberry-bush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
and wild vine. Stepan did all he knew to induce
me to leave the bear to die by inches, and come for
him next day; but this seemed to me not only
unsportsmanlike, but uncertain: so leaving him to
watch Bruin, I crawled into the thicket, and began
forcing my way by a game-track under the bushes
to the place where he lay.</p>

<p>It was a difficult path, and the creepers hampered
me sadly, so that it was not without a considerable
quickening of the pulse that I heard
Stepan screaming, ‘Look out, Barin (master),
for heaven’s sake, here he comes!’ The bushes
parted about ten yards below, and slowly pushing
his way uphill came the bear, swinging his head
from side to side, throwing the blood and foam
from his jaws, and moaning and sobbing hideously.
As soon as he caught sight of me he gave his
jaws a kind of vicious snap, and even managed to
increase his pace to a trot. It was difficult to fire
in my cramped position, but I managed to do it,
and, thanks to his extreme proximity to my rifle’s
muzzle, the ball went right through his head,
passing through a large oak sapling beyond, leaving
a hole in it as clean drilled as if it had been
done with a hot iron.</p>

<p>The bear, when we came to examine him, was
a very old fellow, quite black, and with a skin in
anything but a good condition. However, being
my first bear, we skinned him with great care and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
much exultation, and brought home his head, tired
but rejoicing.</p>

<p>It was still early when we got back to our hut,
not more than mid-day, in fact; but the weather
was of the roughest, and our uprising had been an
early one, so that we were not sorry to pass the
rest of the day in cleaning our bear’s skin and preparing
his flesh for our evening meal. And fresh-killed
bear’s meat takes a considerable time in
preparation, and when the animal happens to be as
old and wiry as the beast killed to-day, not forty
cooks with forty rolling-pins could ever beat his
flesh into a reasonable degree of tenderness.</p>

<p>The Cossacks on the station won’t eat bear’s
flesh, though they only get meat once a week here;
and partly for that reason, and partly because with
their single-barrelled rifles they consider the risk
too great, they never molest the bears. So little
in fact do they know of their comparative harmlessness,
that they gave me quite an ovation when
I came back loaded with spoils to-day, and for the
moment I figured as quite a Nimrod to an admiring
audience of eleven semi-savages.</p>

<p>I had heard a great deal in time past about the
excellence of bear’s hams, and the delicacy of bear’s
paws stewed, but I felt that another of the pleasant
illusions of my youth had been destroyed
when I encountered to-night the mass of boiled
black whipcord, which, in spite of its unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
flavour, was undoubtedly real bear’s ham. As for
the paws, Stepan and myself baked them <i>à la mode</i>
in a little subterranean oven; but on unearthing
them we could find nothing but skin and leather,
with bones and bony sinews, and certainly nothing
to eat. Even our dogs did not seem to make
much of them.</p>

<p>In spite of the poor quality of our food, we
made, however, the heartiest of suppers, having
been strangers to meat for nearly a week; and
with a storm raging outside which seemed to
threaten a repetition of the disastrous flood that
swept our cottage away last year, we slept the
sleep of the weary but successful.</p>

<p>The next day, Saturday, was a red-letter day
for me. Rising rather later than usual, we tried
the other side of our bay of mountains, and, in
spite of the noisy wind, with great success. Hardly
had we forced our way through the growth of
briars at the bottom of the hill into the chestnuts
above when Stepan, turning round, beckoned me to
stop, knelt down, and aiming deliberately, fired at
something which the bushes concealed from me.
On going up to him I found that he had fired at a
boar standing end on to him some thirty yards off,
and, as might be expected, with his extraordinary
weapon, had only succeeded in frightening the
beast.</p>

<p>Angry at the luck which had given Stepan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
such a chance to throw away, I pushed noisily
through the thickets, never dreaming of finding
any more game, at any rate for another half mile.
Yet hardly had we gone three dozen paces from
the spot whence the last shot was fired, when our
ears caught the sound of a bear’s even step close
to us, and approaching still closer. Slipping silently
behind a couple of trees, we waited with our hearts
in our mouths. Softly and deliberately the steps
drew near, with a sound closely resembling the
step of a man slowly picking his way through the
forest. Every now and then the bear paused to
give a loud snuff of inquiry, which, luckily for us,
the constant shifting of the wind in these narrow
valleys completely baffled. At last I got a glimpse
of her passing slowly through the bushes, and
stopping every now and then to pick up the fallen
chestnuts in a leisurely way as she paced along.
I waited for a minute or two until I could see her
grey shoulder plainly through the rhododendrons.
Then I pulled, and wheeling round with a short
sharp cry, she disappeared in the higher covert,
followed in her retreat by a snap-shot from my
second barrel, which evidently did not take effect.</p>

<p>Uncertain whether the bear was killed outright
or only wounded, Stepan and myself were somewhat
shy of following her into her stronghold.
At first we both tried climbing trees, hoping to
get a view of her thus; but finding that of no avail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
I persuaded Stepan to follow me at a distance in a
careful survey of the place in which we had last
seen her. Poor beast, she had not gone far; the
moment she was out of our sight her strength
failed her, and when we found her she was lying
stone dead, not sixty yards from the spot where the
bullet had reached her.</p>

<p>‘Express’ rifles are terribly destructive little
weapons. This second bear was totally unlike
the one killed the day before, at least in colour:
for while he was black, her coat, a very fine one,
was of a soft light brown, so light as to be almost
grey.</p>

<p>On examination we found that she was a yearling,
and was returning from her morning’s work,
the ruin of half a fine chestnut-tree, when we met
her. Some of the boughs she had managed to
break were almost as thick as a man’s waist. On
looking at her fore-arm after Stepan had skinned
her, I could not but reflect that the stories one
meets with from time to time, of hand-to-hand conflicts
with bears, require a large grain of salt for the
swallowing.</p>

<p>Leaving Stepan to finish the skinning, I wandered
on somewhat higher up the hillside. I had
not left him a quarter of an hour when I again
heard the peculiarly soft regular tread of a bear
above me, and after waiting patiently for about five
minutes, I caught a glimpse for a moment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
head of an exact counterpart of the bear then under
Stepan’s hands. Unluckily for me, she sighted me
at the same moment, and with a loud sniff plunged
straight downhill at a pace that, even had the
covert not concealed her, would have rendered my
chance of hitting her extremely problematical. I
saw from the direction she had taken that she
would pass almost over Stepan, and I hurried on
to be able to lend him a hand in case he only
wounded her. But I waited in vain for the report
of my man’s mighty blunderbuss. Sitting engaged
in the sanguinary task of disrobing our dead bear
he had suddenly become aware of what appeared
to him either the shade or the enraged sister of the
deceased charging furiously down upon him; and
oppressed with a consciousness of his guilt, Stepan
fled red-handed from the avenger, leaving his gun
to take care of itself.</p>

<p>Poor Stepan, who was originally I believe no
coward, but in days past, according to his own version,
a mighty hunter, was an instance of a man
who had suddenly lost all his nerve, and this
occurred as follows. One day, when suffering
severely from fever, he was walking along the dried
bed of a mountain torrent, when, on turning a
sharp corner, he almost ran into a large bear. For
a moment they stood facing one another. Stepan,
having no weapons, thought his last hour had
come. There was an awful noise, something struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
him on the face, and for the time the hapless Tscherkess
passed away from this bear-haunted world to
a land of oblivion. On returning to his senses, he
was surprised to find no bear, and no bloody
wound upon his scalp. Further examination
showed him, however, that a bear had stood facing
him, and it was probably the gravel thrown up by
its hind feet as it slewed round in headlong flight,
that had struck Stepan, not stunning him as he
supposed, but merely in his weak state frightening
him out of his senses. Since then until now my
man had only shot at bears from a platform in
a tree at night&mdash;a style of sport extremely free
from danger, as, although Bruin can climb, he
very rarely if ever attempts to do so in pursuit
of a foe.</p>

<p>Living, as Stepan had lived all his life, in
bear-frequented forest lands, he had many a story
to tell of ‘Michael Michaelovitch,’ as the peasants
call him. On one occasion he and a friend had
observed an apple-tree well laden with fruit, some
seven or eight versts from their village in the forest,
standing unclaimed of any man, almost sole relic
of some once prosperous Tscherkess village. Stepan
and his friend, who lived at some little distance,
arranged to meet at the tree one morning early,
and gather the fruit, to be shared amongst them.
Arrived at the tree, Stepan saw some one already
engaged throwing the apples down. Thinking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
friend was trying to steal a march on him, the
irate Stepan heaped all manner of abuse on him,
accused him of spoiling the apples by throwing
them down; and, at last, getting no answer, fairly
yelled with rage, and began to throw things into
the tree. Then the shower of apples ceased, and,
with a gruff snort, a huge old bear came tumbling
out of the tree, almost on top of the terrified
villager. As usual in these cases, Bruin was just
as much frightened as the man, and shambled off
as quickly as possible, leaving the apples to the
friends.</p>

<p>All the Russians and Tscherkesses with whom
I have talked about bears, say there are two kinds
in the Caucasus&mdash;the ordinary big brown bear, and
a smaller one, that lives in the higher ranges, has
a kind of white shirt-front to his coat, and is
much fiercer and more carnivorous than his brown
brother. Dr. Radde, however, of the Tiflis Museum,
tells me there is only one kind; and though I have
myself seen great variety in the sizes and coats of
different individuals killed on the Black Sea coast,
I can well believe he is right. Still, I fancy the
higher ranges of Transcaucasia are very little
known; and it may well be that a variety of the
common bear, differing considerably from the specimens
found on the coast, is to be met with nearer
the snow-line. The peasants tell wonderfully circumstantial
stories of their favourite’s craft (for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
in a way, the bear is a great favourite with the
moujik, and hero of many a droll story): how that
he lies in ambush for the unsuspecting roe or wild
goat, and pounces on him, or knocks him down
with a log used club-fashion, as he passes. Or,
again, that lying hid on a ledge overlooking some
favourite pass of the tûr’s, he rolls huge stones on
his prey as it browses beneath him, and then,
having killed it in this way, climbs down and
dines at his leisure.</p>

<p>Of course all these are mere peasants’ stories,
but as they have been told me repeatedly by
peasants who have lived amongst the beasts of
which the stories are told all their lives, I give
them for what they are worth. There may be
some grains of truth in them.</p>

<p>After putting my bear’s skin out of harm’s
way, and leaving the hams to take their chance
till we returned, Stepan and I continued our hunt.
In a deep glade, where no sunlight came to disturb
the drowsy stillness, something bounded to its feet
with a great noise, and hurried off unseen, making
the whole forest re-echo with its short sharp barks.
The cry was new to me, and I imagined all manner
of grim beasts from whom the sound might have
proceeded, and regretted intensely my evil luck in
not obtaining a shot. Stepan, however, consoled
me by telling me it was only ‘cazeole,’ the roebuck
of this part of the world, which answers&mdash;so an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
old Indian sportsman tells me who has shot many of
these ‘cazeoles,’&mdash;to the Indian ‘karkee.’ Indeed, all
the game found in the Caucasus is the same as, or
very nearly allied to, species found throughout the
mountains of India.</p>

<p>Later on in the day, whilst exploring a rhododendron
thicket at the very summit of a high hill,
shut in and encircled by still higher eminences, I
heard something bolt from me through the rattling
covert, and then pause, and with a loud sniff try to
get my wind. Apparently getting it, the beast
changed his course and proceeded at right angles
to the line of his first rush, and then halting,
again tried for my wind. Luckily for me, shut in
as we were by the higher peaks, the wind kept
veering round; and, thoroughly puzzled and beaten,
the unlucky beast kept changing his course until
at last I, standing behind a tree, saw a long grey
snout and a pair of gleaming white tusks peering
out of a thicket some thirty yards in front of me.
The quick eyes sighted me at once in spite of my
tree, and I had hardly time to fire before the owner
of the eyes had retreated out of sight. Quick as
the shot had to be, however, it was wonderfully
effective, and the boar went crashing head over
heels from top to bottom of the hill, there to rest
still as sudden death could make it until I could get
down to him. The bullet had gone in at the front of
the shoulder, and traversing the whole length of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
spine, had perfectly pulverised it, remaining buried
just under the hide near the root of the tail;
whence I extracted it and still preserve it, smashed
and flattened as it is, a memento of the wonderful
force of the ‘express’ (450) rifle.</p>

<p>Laden with spoils, the bear’s skin and head, as
well as the tidbits taken from the boar, we hurried
home, to send up the Cossacks for the rest of the
boar, which would be a welcome addition to their
perpetual cabbage soup.</p>

<p>To recount day by day our adventures whilst
hunting at Golovinsky would certainly be wearisome
to the general reader; and even the keenest
sportsman has enough blank days of his own without
reading the record of other people’s. In spite
of the fair beginning I had made, in the first two
days of my stay, sport was not always as good or
game so plentiful. Day after day, from dawn to
dusk, often dragging our weary limbs home through
icy torrents, by the feeble rays of a young moon,
without whose light we had already been some time
wandering in the forest darkness, we toiled unceasingly
without getting another bear, although their
tracks abounded everywhere.</p>

<p>Boars were at first fairly plentiful, and with
them we did pretty well, though with them as with
the few bears we did see, Stepan almost invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
got the shot and invariably missed it. Once he
did hit an old she-bear, and a rare mess he very
nearly made of it. I had got sick of seeing nothing,
and was standing on an old log under which a bear
had at one time made his lair, gazing idly down a
long vista of forest below me. As I gazed I saw
a small animal, which at the distance I could not
recognise, being rolled over and over in the dead
leaves by what was unmistakably a bear. I was
on the point of descending to stalk her, when a
report rang out below, and the old bear rolled over
beside her cub. In another moment she was on
her feet again, and using her fore-paw to urge him
along, she was rapidly driving her cub towards me
and away from the spot whence the report had
come. As I watched, too much engrossed to
think of firing, I saw her leave the cub and go
at a really good gallop for something between her
and myself. For a moment I thought I was the
object of her attack; but a view of Stepan, his
wretched old fire-arm as usual abandoned, bolting
like a rabbit, revealed at once the true state of the
case, and I made all haste to his rescue. Seeing me
coming and Stepan stopping as I approached, the
old she-bear turned, much to my surprise and infinitely
to my disgust. Blown with my sharp rush
and unduly excited, I missed the old lady entirely,
or only hit her behind as she dived downhill
through the high covert. Though we heard her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
once or twice, tramping about in the bushes and
growling over her wounds, and though I am convinced
she and the cub were within a few hundred
yards of us whilst we munched the black bread and
onions that made our lunch, we never saw either
of them again.</p>

<p>Black bread and an onion sounds but a poor
kind of refreshment after a hard morning’s work,
yet what real enjoyment that half-hour at lunch
used to be to us, only those who really love forest
life and nature at home can tell. All the mysterious
rustlings of the forest, every breaking twig, suggested
a whole volume of possible adventure to us.
Coming but six weeks before from the stifling
atmosphere of London, every breath of fresh air
seemed full of fresh life, every forest sound replete
with music. The chirping of the green frogs&mdash;those
mysterious little <i>saurians</i> whose bird-like note is
so pitched as rather to lead you from than to their
hiding-place; the harsh shrill note of the handsome
black woodpecker, whose crimson crest is the more
distinctly beautiful as it is his only adornment;
the continual chattering of the traitor jays, who
seem always bent on proclaiming the hunter’s
presence; even the sharp rattle of the chestnuts,
falling over-ripe from the trees; the droning of the
bees, and the tiny but insatiable mosquito, combine,
though in themselves not all harmonious, with the
murmur of the sea and the whisper of the breeze,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
to make a woodland concert, which to some ears
no other music, either of the present or of Herr
Wagner’s future, could ever hope to rival.</p>

<p>Those mosquitoes were the only bitter drop in
our mid-day draught of lazy pleasure. That they
were <i>bonâ fide</i> mosquitoes I do not pretend, though
we called them so, and hated them as much as if
they had been, because, though mere microscopic
midges, the lumps they raised upon us were
worthy of the efforts of a Goliath among mosquitoes.
From every rotten tree-stump rose a perfect
steam of these evil little beasts, and being so
small they could and did get through everything,
and elude all vigilance.</p>

<p>There was another insect pest which used to
cause us considerable annoyance: a kind of tick
which dropped upon us unawares as we brushed
against a bough, and creeping in under one’s clothing
buried its head unfelt in the skin, and there took up
its abode. If not found and dislodged at night,
the body of the creature would grow to such an
extent that in the morning it had the appearance of
a large wart growing upon you, and if left longer
would swell to almost any size, taking root by its
head and requiring infinite care in removing; for of
such a bull-dog nature is the insect that it will
allow its body to be torn from its head rather than
let go its hold. If this happens the result is a bad
wound, hard to heal and apt to fester. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
other insects in these woods, though of a less obnoxious
nature; and from one class to-day we
received a most welcome addition to our larder.</p>

<p>My man spent a good deal of his time in hunting
for honey, and was wonderfully sharp-sighted
when bees were concerned, noticing them at once
across a valley, observing the line of their flight, and
eventually tracking them to their secret hoard with
a certainty that seemed almost like the result of
instinct. These Tscherkesses have a way of making
a rough sort of hive for the wild bees in trees to
which the bees are partial, and I believe respect
each other’s hives when they come across them.
Bruin, however, has less conscience than the
Tscherkess, and if there is one thing which will
tempt him into an indiscretion sooner than another
it is honey. This man told me that once in a tree,
with his nose smeared with honey, and stung all
over by the indignant bees, the bear will go on
feeding greedily, though the whole time he keeps
crying and bemoaning himself for the pain given
him by his tiny foes. At such times, so intent is
he on his feast, that the hunter may approach him as
closely as he pleases, and shoot him at his leisure.</p>

<p>The peacock butterfly was another insect of
which I noticed large numbers from time to time
round the outskirts of the forest; and indeed, in the
whole of autumn in the Caucasus, I never noticed
any butterflies, or only very few, which were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
familiar to me as British insects, while I saw specimens
of almost every butterfly which occurs with
us at home. The most numerous, I think, was the
clouded yellow, and its paler variety ‘hyale.’</p>

<p>The day we got our honey was a red-letter day
for us, for on that occasion our larder reached its
maximum of plenty; the boat, with stores from
Duapsè, turning up on the afternoon of the same
day. A bear’s ham, some pork, black bread, honey,
onions, and a bottle of abomination, labelled ‘Vieux
Rhum, Marseilles,’ which I doubt not had never
been much nearer France than the Crimea, made
my servant’s face beam with delight at the sight of
such unwonted plenty; but alas! from this day
our evil times were to commence; and so bare did
our larder at last become that the very flies that
then swarmed gave us up as inhospitable paupers
before the end of a fortnight.</p>

<p>On trying the part of the forest in which I had
killed my first bear on Monday, we could find no
fresh traces of game, although the place was quite
a warren of old boar runs, and full of beaten roads
made by the bears. The cause of the game’s
absence was evidently the presence of the carcass of
my first bear, which, mangled by jackals, was
already tainting the air far and wide. Some large
game I did almost bag, but that was nearly being
a very serious matter for one of us.</p>

<p>As usual, we took parallel lines along the hillside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and though from time to time a broken twig
betrayed the presence of the one to the other,
Stepan and I were otherwise lost to each other. For
over half-an-hour we had been stalking in this way,
without any event occurring to wake the stillness
of the wood, when from a point above me, and
coming down wind towards me, I heard a sound
like that of approaching game. Slowly it came on,
and as the leaves were crushed softly under its
heavy even tread, which stopped from time to time
that the beast might listen or pick up a chestnut, I
recognised the step as that of Bruin strolling slowly
home after his early breakfast. Stooping to get a
better view through the hazel stems, I saw them
swing and shake some eighty yards above me, and
caught a glimpse at the same moment of something
lighter in colour than the covert passing through
it. Instinctively my rifle covered it, and from that
moment, for quite three minutes I should think, I
followed the bear’s every movement with my rifle’s
muzzle. Twice I half pressed the trigger as a
larger piece of the creature’s grey side was visible
to me, picking his way slowly past me; but just as
I was on the point of firing he turned and came
downhill towards me. Thanking my stars that I
had not fired a random shot into the brown of my
game, I waited for him to come closer. There was
twenty yards from me a little open space, and here,
if he entered it, as he seemed likely to, I meant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
kill him. Jealously my rifle followed his every
movement, dreading a change of direction, and in
another moment the shot would have been fired.
The grey thing suddenly rose on end, or seemed to;
and parting the thorn vine with its fore-arms walked
into the open my man Stepan!</p>

<p>For a moment I felt absolutely sick, and I
don’t think I was ever more unhinged in my life
than I was for the rest of the day; and when,
later on in the heat of noonday, I was resting in
a ravine by a small pool, half dozing after lunch,
hearing the same pace just above me, and seeing
a great patch of grey move through the bushes,
I lost a veritable bear by not firing. So Stepan’s
folly nearly cost him his life, and cost me a bear.
He had, it seemed, gone on too fast to the end of
his beat, and getting tired of waiting for me,
thought he might as well come back to meet me.
Heard on the dead leaves, a bear’s step as he
moves slowly along, stopping from time to time
to feed or listen, is wonderfully like that of a
mocassined hunter stalking slowly over the same
ground.</p>

<p>And now, day after day, the sport grew worse.
Stepan was evidently but a very poor guide.
Living, as he had done, for a couple of lonely years
in his hut at Golovinsky, his spirit of enterprise
had never led him to explore more than the two
beats in which we had already been successful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Beyond these two tracts of forest he knew nothing,
and in this dense covert it is almost useless
to attempt to shoot until you have first explored
a little. If you do attempt it, you find yourself,
sooner or later, lost in a dense mass of thorns, in
which you cannot move without noise&mdash;in which,
in fact, you can scarcely move at all. From above
hang thick curtains of the abominable creeper
which the people call aptly enough ‘wolf’s tooth,’
which is so keen and strong that even my stout
jacket of moleskin was torn by it; while Stepan’s
clothes, though made of the toughest canvas, ceased
to exist, in spite of all his ingenious patchings, by
the end of the fortnight. A few boars and two more
bears were all we could get; and at last I consented
to a trial of Stepan’s vaunted pack. But
not until we had tried every other method did
I consent to having the forests disturbed in this
way.</p>

<p>One day, after twelve hours’ spent in the usual
stalking, Stepan and I perched ourselves like ungainly
birds each in a tree above a hole full of mud
and water, in which herds of swine wallowed nightly.
But our limbs grew cramped, and the moon rose
higher in the heavens, making quaint patterns on
the dark hole below, without our ever being disturbed
in our night-watch. As the moon grew
more dim, we climbed down again with aching
limbs; and as Stepan relieved his feelings by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
hoarse cough long pent up, a sudden charge
through the thickets close by, with indignant
snortings, told us that the herd was just approaching
as we left.</p>

<p>On our way back, as we crossed a small tributary
of the Golovinsk, a big silvery thing slid off a
stone into the water, and swam along the bottom
of the shallow stream close by me. In the grey
morning light it looked to my drowsy eyes like a
large fish, and it was not until I heard Stepan’s
wretched old gun miss fire that I recognised in it
a very fine otter; then, of course, it dived into
deeper water, and was lost to us. Many of these,
as well as a few sea-otters, are found between
Novorossisk and Sukhoum, and my man showed
me the skins of several which he had killed; but
though I frequently saw their spoor, this was the
only live specimen it was ever my luck to see.</p>

<p>Another long night we sat down under a
juniper bush on the shingle that has, at some time
or other, formed the bed of a broader Golovinsk, or
has been brought down by the stream during its
winter floods. On the opposite bank rose the hill
forest, coming down in thorny thickets to the
water’s edge. Half a mile behind us, on our side
the stream, the other forest began, and a quarter
of a mile below us the sea kept moaning. On all
the little patches of sand the tracks of game were
numerous and recent, and we had good hopes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
sport: indeed we needed them to keep us up through
that cold night. On the far side of the river there
was a large tract of sand and clay, which was
one close-written record of the goings and comings
of thirsty beasts. Yet all that weary night we
saw hardly anything. At six we marched down
to those icy waters of tribulation as men prepared
to do or die&mdash;that is, to be miserable as comfortably
as possible. Pitching ourselves and a flask of
Marseilles ‘rhum’ into the bush, we arranged
that Stepan should watch until midnight, and the
morning watch should be mine. With a stone for
a pillow, and my knees tucked up to my chin,
I soon slept to the tune of the stream at my feet,
to wake in about an hour’s time shivering and wet
through with the mist. The sound of a well-known
snore explained to me how rigid had been
Stepan’s vigil; and as two or three dusky forms
bolted back into the thicket on the far side as I
rose unwarily to kick him, I bitterly regretted
that I had not kept watch all night through.</p>

<p>Resolving not to disturb my trusty henchman,
I settled myself in the warmest corner I could
find, and prepared to keep watch till morning.
And I did so through all that livelong night, until
the Pleiads had worked right round into the
west: a little querulous wind arose, the stars grew
greyer and greyer, there came a sudden bitter
chill into the air, to which all the cold of the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
had been as nothing, and then we knew it was
morning.</p>

<p>A violent shake roused Stepan, and without
troubling ourselves about more breakfast than a
crust of black bread and the flask afforded, we
went into the forest. Here we had a blank day;
though had Stepan chosen to fire, he had a splendid
chance at two bears; but as I was at some distance,
he held his hand, apparently from prudential
motives.</p>

<p>When we came back late that evening, empty-handed,
to conclude our twenty-four hours of toil
with a march of a mile over the bed of the Golovinsk&mdash;feeling
its boulders through our worn
mocassins as plainly as if we were barefooted; the
small stones burning into our sore feet like hot
irons, while from the big ones we slipped, risking
sprains and breakages every other step, and getting
clear of the stones only to plunge into the icy
stream&mdash;when we were enduring all this, I might, I
think, be forgiven if I said ‘Amen’ to the Russian
proverb which my wretched guide kept repeating,
to the effect that ‘the chase is worse than slavery.’
It does not say much for the sporting spirit of the
Russians that such should be a favourite proverb
among them; but in Stepan’s case, where he had
all his share of the toil and none of the enthusiasm
which novelty lent me to keep him up, it
was a pardonable sentiment. Poor fellow, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
quite tragic to see him, having crossed his enemy
the Golovinsk for the last time that night, sit
down beside its waters, and, casting the remnants
of a pair of mocassins into the stream, walk home
barefoot.</p>

</div>

<p>After our twenty-four hours of unsuccessful
labour recorded in my last chapter, we were too
tired and too tattered to take the field again next
day. So we spent it in drying our clothes, mending
and washing them, constructing fresh mocassins
from the hide of one of our boars, and
generally preparing for a campaign of another
kind against our enemies the bears and boars.</p>

<p>In this campaign we were to be assisted by a
canine force, consisting of three mangy curs
belonging to Stepan, and one utterly useless beast,
the property of the neighbouring Cossack station.
Stepan’s trio were, in their way, the three ugliest
half-starved mongrels that ever were possessed
with the pluck of a gamecock and the unreasoning
devotion that never shows itself in anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
but a dog. Why they should have been Stepan’s
faithful slaves no human reasoning could explain.
They could have picked up more by themselves
than he could give them. Poor fellow, he never
had any great abundance for himself. They had
to sleep outside the shanty, were kicked if they put
their noses inside, and were devoured by the mange,
which their master never seemed to think of
curing. As for breed they had none, or perhaps
I should say they had a touch of every breed in
them. Zizda was said to be in some way connected
with a race which they called ‘harlequin;’
and if oddity of shape, oddness of eyes, and a
general unevenness of colour and outline, entitle
a dog to the name, old Zizda was a veritable
harlequin. He was a large dog with huge paws,
a very square head, wall eyes, a capital nose, and
indomitable pluck, which had from time to time
earned him the innumerable scars with which he
was marked from tail to muzzle. The other two
were utter mongrels, but staunch supporters of old
Zizda in any emergency. They were an old bitch
called Lufra, and a young dog, Orla, or ‘The
Eagle.’ I cannot refrain from giving the dogs’
names, because they were such real heroes in the
chase, and good servants to me.</p>

<p>The first duty of our day of rest, then, was to
feed our pack&mdash;a duty often forgotten, and appreciated
by the dogs now as an unprecedented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
attention from us. This done, we busied ourselves
in getting the skins of the game we had
killed ready to send away, as a boat had been
seen passing a day or two before, and having been
signalled to, had promised, if possible, to call on
its way back from Sotcha. It called to-day, took
our skins on to Kertch, and left us a good supply
of tobacco, the want of which we had hitherto
keenly felt.</p>

<p>Another visitor turned up to-day to our utter
surprise (for visitors are rare at Golovinsky)&mdash;the
head gardener from the Grand Duke Michael’s
forest of Ardenne, who had been out hunting for
two days and taken nothing. With him was a
Greek from a colony somewhere near, who complained
bitterly that though he and his fellow
colonists had spent most of their nights about
harvest-time on platforms or trees, to shoot at and
scare the bears and boars, these gentry had completely
destroyed the crop of ‘koukourooz’ (maize),
on which the Greek villagers greatly depend.
When I found that in spite of the number of
guns in the trees, not one bear or boar had been
killed, I was not so much surprised at Bruin
coming to look upon the noise as merely a military
salute intended in his honour, which in no way
interfered with his appetite.</p>

<p>From time to time during the day I managed
to extract a little information from the taciturn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Stepan, but his lonely life has made him so
reserved as to be almost inaccessible to the wiles
of the inquirer. He is a Tscherkess who has
abjured Mahometanism without apparently adopting
any other faith; so of his religion he had
little to tell. About his village and the life in it
he said little more, and of the Tscherkess wars
he absolutely refused to speak&mdash;though on that
topic he evidently had more to say&mdash;from what
seemed to me a fear lest any words of his being
repeated might get him into trouble. So we fell
back upon natural history, and on this topic he
was fairly fluent.</p>

<p>Amongst other things he told me of some
quaint habits of the hedgehog&mdash;for I presume it
was the hedgehog and not the porcupine he meant;
for the word he used for the beast was one which
I did not know, being Tscherkess patois of some
kind. But from his description the animal was
either one or the other; and as the porcupine is
only supposed, I think, to inhabit the Persian
border of the Caucasus, the animal of Stepan’s
story was probably a hedgehog. He described a
hedgehog perfectly, and then added that there were
two kinds in the Caucasus, one with head and feet
like a pig, the other with head and feet like a
hound. It was one of the latter which he noticed
one day under an apple-tree in the forest, collecting
and carrying off the fallen fruit by rolling over it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
(so he described it) until she had impaled an apple
on one of her spines. She then impaled another
on the other side of her body, and thus laden,
retired for some time, to return without her load,
for two more apples. This sounds very unlikely
to me, but as the fellow had no object in inventing
the story, and invariably told me the truth as far
as I could discover, I give it, as well as other yarns
from the same source, for what it is worth. Of the
same beast the Cossacks and Stepan assert that he
kills snakes by seizing their tails in his jaws and
then rolling on them, turning a somersault over
them, in fact, so as to drive the spines into them.</p>

<p>I heard too, to-day, a quaint superstition about
the common bracken, which abounds here, and on
the roots of which the swine feed when there are
no chestnuts or berries to be had. The Circassians
say there is one moment in one night of the year
(alas, my authority had forgotten which night),
at the very stroke of midnight, when this plant
blooms. The flower lasts but a few moments, in
the which if any one has the good fortune to gather
and preserve it, he obtains omniscience thenceforth.
Talking of such things as the foregoing, and making
fresh mocassins for the morrow, the day soon passed,
and we rolled ourselves up in our rugs and were
happy, though we went to bed almost dinnerless.</p>

<p>The sea rose to-night, and raged as the Black
Sea sometimes does, in so wild a way that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
almost forgets its habitual calm in these short
bursts of Berserker fury. So close did the white
waves come to our fragile hut, that we began to
tremble lest the sea should wash through the ground
floor (our only floor), as it had done once last
winter; and in the middle of the night old Zizda,
pressing close to the wall outside for comfort from
the keen wind and driven spray, pushed his way
right through the lath and plaster, and appeared
wet and unceremonious by my bedside. Whether
he found it much warmer inside than out I very
much doubt. It must have been very bitter outside
if he did. But by morning, though the waves
were still white below, a bright sun was shining,
and the rain-drops had been dried off the grass.</p>

<p>We gave the sun another hour or two to
complete his good work, and then, at about nine,
started for the forest with our pack.</p>

<p>The method of procedure was simplicity itself.
Once in the forest each dog went whithersoever he
pleased, and the whole team, cruising about at
random, at last hit on the track of something and
gave tongue. Then, with our ears only to lead us,
we made to what seemed the likeliest spot to intercept
the dogs and their quarry, and right good fun
it was, though rough work in the extreme. Bad
as are the briars and tangled masses of vine, I
think the frequent ravines and hillsides, covered
with their fine short grass, are infinitely worse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Rushing pell-mell to the scene of action, you expect
to have face and hands lacerated as you go and
take it with equanimity, content if only you can
force a way at all. But having forced a way, it is
annoying to have your feet slip upon those dry
hillsides, and, perfectly helpless, feel yourself and
rifle rapidly gliding downhill away from the point
towards which, at so much personal inconvenience,
you have been struggling. It was better fun to
see Stepan, as he strove to descend a ravine, slide
helplessly down, sixty miles an hour, to a pool at
the bottom, into which he unceremoniously plopped,
pursued at once by Zizda, who followed his master
on his haunches, looking the picture of imbecile
misery. But for bipeds and even ordinary quadrupeds
there is some excuse, seeing that Bruin
himself often comes to grief in these places. Witness
the numerous slides on these banks, looking
as if Bruin had been diverting himself and his
family by the innocent amusement of trebogging.</p>

<p>Throughout the forest where we were hunting
to-day, we found every here and there the traces
of Tscherkess villages, whose occupants have fled,
some long ago in the old war time, and some only
last spring, to join the Turks in their war against
Russia. Even in the case of these latter no sign
of a house remained, only a piece of ground more
level than that which surrounded it, overgrown with
a dense jungle of briar; here and there a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
hand-wrought wood, a relic of some Circassian house
furniture, and fruit-trees that were merged into the
forest when their owners joined the Turks. These
old ‘aouls’ are very strongholds of Bruin, and his
work is visible on all sides. Little pathways, beaten
smooth through the briary places, torn-down
branches of the walnut and apple, and bees’ nests
dug out where none but he could have got at them,
all attest his presence.</p>

<p>It was from one of these old ‘aouls’ that our
dogs first got anything to make a really good stand.
The ‘aoul’ had been on the very summit of one of
the chain of hills on which we were shooting. The
site of it was covered with acres of dense briars,
from the midst of which towered what had probably
been the village pride, a patriarchal chestnut
of enormous size. Here Zizda gave out his deep
bass warning that game was afoot, and the other
three curs made a chorus of it. I was down below
in a belt of chestnuts outside the region of briars;
and thinking that whatever the game was, it would
probably break downhill from the thicket in which
the dogs were baying it by a little track that passed
me, I jumped on to a tree-stump and waited.
Stepan was on the other side of the briars, quite
close to the scene of action, and I naturally imagined
would close in still more and get his shot.
After waiting a good ten minutes, during which
time neither game, dogs, nor Stepan appeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
move an inch, I whistled to let the latter know
that I was coming to the assistance of the brave
dogs which he was leaving to their fate. To force
my way uphill through those briars was a labour
worthy of Hercules; and if the game should have
broken through the dogs, there would have been
small chance for the hunter fast meshed in that
briary net. When at last I did get a view of the
field of battle, so dense were the briars that I could
not have swung my arms round where I stood;
and though I stood on tiptoe, all I could discern
were the waving sterns of Orla and Lufra, the
brave old veteran Zizda being too close to his
quarry to be visible; but from where I stood I
could hear his sharp charges and the low snorts
of rage which they elicited from the object of his
attack.</p>

<p>Unable to see to shoot, I picked up a clod, and
guessing the beast’s whereabouts by the low muttered
thunder that came from the roots of the
chestnut, I heaved it over the dogs in the direction
of the sound. Then for a moment the briars
swayed as if an earthquake had moved them; one
of the dogs yelled as he was rolled over, with
another scar added to his already numerous decorations;
and then, not ten paces from me, passing
at a gallop went the biggest wild boar I ever hope
to see. And I missed him. It is true that I had
but a momentary glimpse at him as he shot across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
a yard of open, and I snapped at him as one would
at a bolting rabbit; but I shall never forgive myself
for missing his enormous broadside for all
that. Far through the crashing forest I heard
him, with the dogs at his heels, for almost ten
minutes after I had missed him; but I never saw
him again.</p>

<p>I had heard frequently previous to this of the
immense size of these Caucasian boars when old and
lonely, and have myself since seen the specimen in
the Tiflis Museum killed by the Grand Duke or one
of his friends at the Royal forest of Kariâs, which is
said to weigh twenty-one puds; and as sixty-two
puds go to the ton, this would make him about 780
pounds. But in my own mind I feel convinced
that the boar that charged past me from his dark
fastness at the root of that old chestnut was half
as large again. Every angler knows that the fish
you miss is the heaviest that ever rose at your fly;
of course I may have misjudged the dimensions
of my boar, and therefore ask no one to believe
in his immense size, though firmly believing in
it myself.</p>

<p>That boars should grow to an enormous size
here, where they are never disturbed, and where
every variety of food to which they are peculiarly
partial is so abundant, is hardly to be wondered
at. The forests are full of all sorts of fruit, of
which bears and boars alone have the gathering;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
patches of bracken, on the roots of which the boar
feeds, are on every hillside; at certain seasons of
the year he finds quantities of fish washed upon
the shore, and on these he riots. As for the chestnuts,
some idea of their abundance may be formed
from the fact that, kneeling in one place not purposely
selected, to-day, I filled all my pockets with
fallen chestnuts without once changing my position;
and yet their only use is to fatten the wild
boar, who munches them husks and all, or more
dainty Bruin, who eats the nuts, but leaves the
husk in his path.</p>

<p>Once during the day I saw an old bear as I
struggled through a veil of thorn vine up a
slippery hillside, and firing brought him down
with what was almost a bellow of rage or pain, in
a succession of somersaults that took him past me
down the hill at a pace that he would never have
attained to by his ordinary method of progression.
But, alas, on searching for him at the bottom of
the hill where he should have lain, we found no
trace of him; and though the dogs followed for
a while, a large stream which he had crossed foiled
them, and sent us back empty-handed.</p>

<p>Twice during that day did I get into close
proximity to big game without seeing anything.
Once in the thicket, whence the old boar had
charged, I had forced my way beyond all hope
of a speedy return, when the sound of Stepan’s gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
down below, and the sharp treble of the younger
dog’s bark, told me something was afoot in that
direction. Straight towards me up the hill came the
dogs, and right eagerly did I look for a tree as
a coign of vantage from which to get a view of the
approaching game before he absolutely ran over
me. But there was not even a stump in reach.
Round me was perhaps a yard of almost open
space, but beyond this the briars formed a wall
impenetrable everywhere, except at the point at
which I had entered the little opening by an old
boar’s run. To quit the opening by the only
apparent outlet, on my hands and knees, with my
tail to an approaching foe, did not seem prudent:
so I remained where I was, hoping I should
see whatever the game might be before it saw
me. Suddenly, though the dogs were still only
halfway up the hill, struggling slowly through
the brake, as impenetrable almost to them as to
us, right at my elbow I heard a heavy breath
drawn, half sigh and half sniff, and then a soft
shuffling of feet in the hidden places of the thicket.
Almost directly this was followed by another and
another sniff, and I knew that a bear was deliberately
walking round me, trying to get out probably
by the road by which I had entered. I
would rather not have been there I admit, as Bruin
fairly cornered is an ugly foe to face; and I fully
expected that when the dogs arrived on the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
he would go for his own private pathway, taking
me as a mere obstruction <i>en route</i>, as I never for a
moment doubted but that he was the beast the
dogs had roused. As I stood expectant, a lovely
wild cat, with a fine tawny skin, marked almost as
clearly as a tiger’s, stole snakelike across the opening,
utterly unheeding me, and disappeared in the
brake beyond. Expecting the bear in another
minute I let the cat go, and regretted it directly
after, for with a regular burst of hounds’ music
our pack dashed into the open, mad after their cat,
and went raging on, taking no notice of the larger
game close by. We searched afterwards, and found
that a bear had really been there, and had stolen off
by another of the hidden ‘trapinkas’ (game tracks)
with which the whole brake was warrened. The
dogs treed the cat, and we spent our luncheon hour
in smoking her out.</p>

<p>The other occasion on which I got too close to
big game that day was in a rhododendron brake,
when our dogs, having bayed something on the
other side of the hill, I was hurriedly forcing my
way to them, when I became aware of sniffings and
tramplings to the right of me and to the left of me,
and plunging wildly on, nearly ran into something
else advancing. Had the rhododendron clump not
been exceptionally high (higher far than my
head), I could have seen my game and had capital
sport; as it was, I was kept fumbling about in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the thicket for nearly ten minutes, expecting every
moment to run up against a bear, who was at the
same time just as anxious not to come into collision
probably as I was.</p>

<p>Tired and happy after a good day’s sport, during
which the fun of racing after the dogs had been
a pleasant change from the ordinary silent stalking,
we wended our way home, the dogs at last
keeping fairly close to our heels. When we were
down in the flat by our old enemy, the snow-fed
Golovinsk, the moon came up hazy and dim, and
the owls began their weird hootings; then with
a sudden rush the dogs left our heels, and were
once more wakening the echoes with a nocturnal
chorus worthy of the Demon Hunter’s infernal pack.
In the patchwork of moonlight we caught a
glimpse of something scudding away before the
dogs, and joined heartily in the chase, forgetting
our fatigue in the excitement. After ten minutes’
slow hunting in the briars they bayed him in a
dense clump, where some larger trees shut out the
silver moonshine and made midnight of the place.
This wood being a favourite resort of bears at
night, on account of the roseberries with which
the place abounded, and of which they are fond, we
went somewhat cautiously to work, and as we
pushed out of the moonlight into the darkness we
went shoulder to shoulder, literally feeling our way
with our rifles. The dogs were right at our feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and, as I expected, were sitting heads in air under
a tall tree, on one of the limbs of which I could
just make out in the moonlight an excrescence
which experience taught me must be a wild cat.
Rifle-shooting by moonlight is not as easy as by
daylight; and though the cat came down, I don’t
think she was hit hard; probably not hit at all,
but merely dislodged by the bough beneath her
being broken. However, be that as it may, when
she did come down, she scattered the dogs right
and left, and got clear away into the thicket again.
Long after, when we were smoking the last pipe
rolled in our rugs, we could hear them making
music either over her or some luckless jackal which
they had come across.</p>

<p>But this, our great day with the dogs, was the
last on which fortune smiled on us at Golovinsky.
From that day we got from bad to worse. No
more boars fell to our guns, and on wild cats and
fresh bear’s meat even a hungry Tscherkess will
hardly feed. But when our supply of bear’s meat
failed too, and nothing but a cheese rind remained,
we grew desperate, and having heard of a place
with a name fathoms long about ten miles from
Golovinsky, where boar abounded, and had not
been lately disturbed, we hired two horses from
the Cossacks, and with one of them for a guide
started to try our luck there. As usual, the guide
knew as little of the way as we did, so that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
spent nearly all the day in getting to our ground,
and, on arriving, found not only no vestige of the
hut which we had been told existed there, but no
chestnut forests either. Add to this that, though
the scenery was even finer than at Golovinsky, the
herbage grew more rankly luxuriant every hundred
yards as we rode up the glen&mdash;the mist, which rose
in a white wall round us, drenching us to the skin
before we had been in it a quarter of an hour&mdash;and it
will not appear so strange that, having toiled all
day to get there, I gave the order at once for a
counter-march, considering that to pass one night
in this den of fever would be certainly dangerous,
and possibly fatal to some of us.</p>

<p>I was not far wrong, as events proved, for next
day, although I had beaten such a hasty retreat,
Stepan and the Cossack were both down with the
fever, and I had an attack of intense lassitude and
headache, which, if yielded to, would probably
have resulted in the same. Stepan told me the
weather was becoming dangerously feverish, an
east wind having set in, which is always the harbinger
of ill to the Tscherkess on the Black Sea
coast. Fever never comes, they say, when the
wind is from off the sea; but when it comes from
behind the hills, then it is that the fever seizes its
wretched victims.</p>

<p>As we climbed over the hills or up the watercourses
to-day, the cold wind that was blowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
would lull for a minute, and a soft hot blast come
over us, just as if fresh from the mouth of some
furnace. Then the fresh breeze rising would blow
it off again. These puffs of hot wind recurred at
long intervals throughout the day, and were, Stepan
assured me, sure precursors of fever. Whether
they really were so, or whether his croaking
frightened us into it, I don’t know, but next day
we were certainly extremely ill. Stepan had
genuine fever, and as all Russians and Tscherkesses
do, lay down at once and gave the fever full
play.</p>

<p>I had read somewhere of a doctor on the African
coast who used to get his fever patients into a
room with doors and windows shut, and there make
them have the gloves on with him for a quarter of
an hour, after which the fever left them. I owe
that athletic doctor my best thanks for his example,
and hereby tender them; for though I had no
gloves, and no one to use them upon if I had, I
acted on what seemed to me the principle of his
cure, and, selecting the stiffest bit of country
I knew, started on a solitary hunt with the
dogs. At first I reeled, and my knees gave under
me at every stride. I was sick and blind and
dizzy, and felt altogether worse than I ever did,
even after the first half-mile of a Rossall paper
chase as a boy; but gradually things improved, as
they always do if you stick to it, and I had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
satisfaction of shaking off the fever, never to be
troubled with it any more, though I have spent
days in Poti, of which town Baron von Thielmann
says, in his excellent book on the Caucasus,
that ‘no European has passed a night there and
been spared the fever.’</p>

<p>It is my firm belief that abstinence from water
whilst in the chase or on the journey will be found
almost a safeguard against fever, and if, in spite of
this, the mists and chills of the undrained swamps
are too much for the traveller’s constitution, a good
bout of violent exercise, taken as soon as the fever
seizes him, will free him from his illness in its
infancy.</p>

<p>That the natives suffer from fever is not to be
wondered at. They live so poorly that an Englishman
would die of want of nourishment alone,
did he live as they do. They sleep out in mists
that soak through and through a man as no rain
ever could, and, worse than all, in the chase or
on the journey, when heated and over-wrought,
they lie down at every rill, and drink like thirsty
cattle. I attribute my own freedom from fever to
the fact that I never touched the water of the
Caucasus for drinking purposes, except in the
shape of one cup of tea in the morning and one at
night, never drinking at all throughout the day;
and though my tongue sometimes grew dry and
seemed almost to rattle in my mouth, habit soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
enabled me to do without water, and that without
any great discomfort.</p>

<p>But, although I avoided fever myself, and
believe that with these precautions a foreigner might
well pass some time in the Caucasus and escape,
more especially if he went in late autumn and
returned by the end of March, I have no wish to
describe the Caucasus, more especially the Black
Sea coast and the neighbourhood of Ekaterinodar
and the Kuban, as anything but a nest of fever.
Where the vegetation is as rank, and marshes so
frequent and of such extent as those round Poti
and Lenkoran on the Caspian, the summer time is
a dangerous time for even the most prudent.</p>

<p>For two or three more days, after our visit to
the valley of mist and fever, I continued to hunt
near Golovinsky, though my man was too ill to help
me much. But day after day proved more decisively
that unless I could get deeper into the forest
than I had ever penetrated yet, my labour would
continue to be but labour in vain. So I determined
to return to Heiman’s Datch, the old ruin
where I got my first boar on this coast, and
after spending a few days there in search of the
panther which I had wounded, or another if he
was dead, return to Duapsè and thence to Kertch.
To this I felt impelled by a number of reasons, of
which the bareness of our larder was by no means
the least. For over a week chestnuts had formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the greater part of my fare, bread even running
short, and as for meat we had none. Often at
night I had had to tighten my belt as the best way
of reducing the vacuum I had no means of filling.
But this is a method of which Nature soon wearies,
and I was longing greedily for even the good things
of Duapsè.</p>

</div>

<p>Of my second visit to Heiman’s Datch I shall say
but little, as, though interesting to me, it would
only entail a great deal of repetition for the reader.
I killed two bears, I believe, of which I bagged
one, the largest specimen of a brown bear I have
ever seen; his head, set up by Burton, of Wardour
Street, is in my library now, and in no way belies
my description of him. With the boars we did not
do much good, but we at least did enough to get
a fresh supply of meat, though of the coarsest kind.
On one night I sent Stepan back along the coast
at his own request to fetch his dogs from Golovinsky.
It was a ten-verst tramp, and he chose the night to
do it in. I regretted when he came back next
morning that I had not accompanied him, for on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
his way he met a couple of bears at different points,
both of which appear to have been much bolder by
night than they ever are by day. He fired at one
of them and missed him. The brute turned round
and appeared to search for the origin of the noise;
and if Stepan is to be believed he passed a very
‘mauvais quart d’heure,’ motionless behind a big
piece of drift-wood, while Bruin sat up and watched
for him. However, the wind was not right for the
bear, so he moved off at last, leaving Stepan to
pursue his course unmolested, but resolved never to
fire at another bear by night, alone and on foot&mdash;a
resolution to which he stuck religiously when,
some half hour afterwards, he met another coming
from the direction of his own cottage.</p>

<p>Arrived at home, he found the dogs had gone
off to the Cossack station, and in their absence the
bears had been down from the hills to visit him, overturning
his hives, and even breaking the door of his
hut. I felt doubts in my own mind as to whether
the Cossacks had not been before the bears in these
matters, but as it was a damage which could not be
remedied, it mattered little who bore the blame.</p>

<p>Returning in the grey morning, Stepan had a
chance at a sea otter, which he wounded but lost.
I feel that it is only fair to say for Stepan that with
a proper rifle he was not such an extraordinarily
bad shot as his constant misses would imply; but
a sight of the tool he used would convince any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
sportsman that with such a weapon the chief danger
was to be apprehended from it by the person
behind it. Stepan’s way of loading, too, was
curious: two bullets, one in its ordinary condition,
the other chewed into a ragged lump of lead, over
a heavy charge of powder: such was his ordinary
charge; but when, as on one occasion, to this was
added a second charge of powder and small slugs
for pheasants, to save the trouble of extracting the
first charge, with an extra bullet put in next day
to meet all emergencies, the only wonder is that
the weapon was not more fatal to Stepan than
to the old she-bear into which he put this extraordinary
broadside.</p>

<p>But now I must bid good-by to Stepan, whose
last duty was to procure me a horse from the
next Cossack station to convey myself and my
bears’ skulls to Duapsè. I bid good-by to my
servant with hearty goodwill, for though a poor
guide and worse sportsman, he was a faithful, obliging
fellow, and honest in the extreme.</p>

<p>From Heiman’s Datch to Duapsè is, they say,
only thirty-eight versts; but the road over the
shingle at the foot of the cliffs was so bad that it
took me from 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> to 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> to accomplish the
journey. I did not stay even for food by the way,
but plodded steadily on at a foot’s pace among
rocks and boulders, with the Tartar saddle galling
my limbs, and a fierce sun pouring down on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
grey cliffs, until everything appeared at a white heat,
and all life seemed stilled, except for the myriads
of lizards that revelled in the fierce sunlight at the
cliff’s foot. But all things must have an end, and
at 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I was at rest in the telegraph station,
with a substantial dinner before me and a bottle
of beer, which, if not Bass’s, bore at any rate
some faint resemblance to the beverage beloved of
Britons.</p>

<p>On the Sunday morning, November 9, I
received a polite message from the Governor of
Duapsè to warn me that, as the Caucasus was
still under military law, and not as yet entirely
settled, I must oblige him by not going to stay in
any Tscherkess ‘aoul,’ and if I neglected this warning,
he added that my words and deeds would be
watched. Moreover, he requested that I would
bring my shooting trip in his district to an end.
This sounded a formidable message; but on interviewing
the Governor I found him not by any
means inclined to be unpleasant, and indeed his
only desire appeared to be to prevent my getting
into scrapes by meddling with politics, though, at
the same time, he was evidently exercised in his
own mind as to the real object of my visit to the
Black Sea coast; as he, in common with all the
other Russians I met, seemed to find it impossible
to believe that any man would visit a distant land
merely for sport. Several times I had warnings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
from various English residents in the Caucasus
that I was suspected of being a British agent, and,
as such, was fully described to the police, and
carefully watched. Unluckily for me, the boat to
Kertch only calls every Wednesday, so that I had
three weary days to pass in Duapsè.</p>

<p>One of these I spent in a visit to a mountain
farm belonging to a German baron, and worked
by two young Germans, his bailiffs. Here I saw
a collection of insects made on the farm, and
amongst them recognised, in addition to the
species I have mentioned as seen by me before,
both the British varieties of the swallow-tailed
butterfly, the small wood white, the marbled white,
the privet, and the elephant hawk moth, as well
as the death’s head, which abounds here. There
were also oak-eggers and stag-beetles, as well as
another hawk moth of a delicate fawn colour, which
was strange to me.</p>

<p>Returning from the hill farm I had an adventure
which might have terminated worse. The
road from Duapsè to the farm, which is situated
at a great height above the sea, winds about the
hill in zigzag lines. Over the road, which is
steep and rough, hang the edges of the forest, and
from time to time it crosses a rough wooden
bridge, spanning a chasm of considerable pretensions.
By daylight these chasms and their
wooden bridges mattered but little, for though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the bridge trembled as the droggie passed over
it, there was not much chance of an accident so
long as you and your horse could see where you
were going. After my day’s shooting I stayed
late at the young Germans’, waiting to share with
them their evening meal, so that it was already
dark when I prepared for my ride home. I had
calculated on a moon, but, the night being stormy,
I was disappointed, and when I did make a start
it was on a young horse, in almost utter darkness,
and knowing very little of my way. However,
the Germans consoled me by telling me that the
road to Duapsè was the only road from their farm
to anywhere, and it had no roads branching from it&mdash;moreover,
the horse knew his way.</p>

<p>At supper they had told me that one of them,
riding into Duapsè some weeks prior to my visit,
had been sprung at by some animal from the trees
overhanging the path; and though there was
not sufficient light to distinguish the beast by,
it was supposed by them to have been a lynx
or a leopard. Not much distressed about this
danger, but anxious about the bridges, I started
on my lonely ride. All went well until I was half
way to the river which separates Duapsè from the
base of the hill. Then, as we got to the darkest
part of the road, where the trees overhung it most,
my horse suddenly turned back, and tried to bolt
for home. In spite of all my exertions I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
not get him beyond a particular point on the road
home for some time; and when at last I did drive
him past with heels and whip, he dashed away
with a sudden plunge, and, catching the bit in his
teeth, bolted as hard as he could gallop from that
point to Duapsè&mdash;or, rather, the river that gives
that town its name. It was no good my trying
to stop the hard-mouthed little beast with the
feeble tackle at my service, and, dashing through
the darkness over the roughest of roads, I could
only sit still, and hope that the sagacity and keen
sight of the horse might save both his neck and
my own. I had no time to feel nervous as we
crossed the first bridge, which seemed to rock as
we dashed over it&mdash;a couple of bounds, and we
were on the other side&mdash;but from that to the next
bridge my mind was tortured with visions of the
horse’s feet slipping from under him on one of the
poles, and the inevitable fall that must follow.
But horses have wonderful eyes, and, if left to
themselves, see as well in a dark night, I think, as
their riders do by day; and, in spite of the rough
road and the bridges, we were soon breast deep in
the stream, and half swimming, half fording it,
came in safety to the other shore.</p>

<p>Amongst other things which served to pass my
time whilst waiting for the boat at Duapsè was a
peasant’s wedding supper. At the ceremony itself
I was not present, but I presume it was like all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
other weddings in the Greek Church, with its
crowns held over the heads of the principal parties,
and its symbolical knotting of the handkerchief.
But the supper and its ceremonies were strange to
me. During it the happy pair came in, not partaking
of it with the rest, but merely presenting
themselves to perform certain ceremonies. Of
these the first was to take a blessing from the old
people. This they did, turning in succession to
each of the four quarters of the earth. Refreshments
having been brought in, and all sitting
except the bride and groom, these latter handed to
each guest in turn a glass of wine or spirits, a cake
and a coloured handkerchief. The cake you eat,
the handkerchief you were expected to pocket as a
wedding gift from the ‘nouveaux-mariés,’ and the
wine you drank; but if in drinking it you were
maliciously inclined, it was open to you, without
appearing guilty of rudeness, to declare it was sour.
At the word ‘gorko’ (sour) the wretched bride
and groom were obliged to exchange embraces in
public, and this as often as you chose to repeat the
sorry joke. In return for the cake, wine, and
kerchief, each guest was expected to place some
wedding gift on the tray for the young couple, and
in this instance the gifts were made in every case in
money.</p>

<p>After these ceremonies had been concluded, the
chief actors retired, and left the guests to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
merry at their leisure. There seemed in this particular
instance to be a chorus of old women
engaged to sing, dance, and otherwise become
objects of ridicule. These hideous old crones
gained the goodwill of the guests, as well as
innumerable drink-offerings of neat vodka, by
singing lugubrious chants, to my uneducated ear
more fit for a funeral than a wedding. This they
supplemented by indecent antics on their hind legs,
and a great deal of coarse buffoonery. The only
musical instrument was one in great favour
amongst the moujik class&mdash;I mean the concertina.
As for the other guests (for I presume the old
women were invited and not paid jesters), they sat
down steadily to gorge and to drink, and so well
did they stick to their self-imposed task of making
beasts of themselves, that the wedding supper
lasted until the morning of the third day, when its
drunken harmony was finally marred by one
drunkard beating a girl, and another breaking a
bottle over the head of the first, at which crisis the
law stepped in and took the supper party under its
own protecting wing.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, November 13, I gladly shook
the dust of Duapsè off my feet, and embarking in
one of the Russian Company’s steamers, passed
pleasantly thence to Novorossisk. I was obliged
to return to Ekaterinodar to recover my luggage
and to obtain any letters which might have arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
for me during my absence at Golovinsky; and
anxious to see as much of the Caucasus as possible,
I arranged to steam to Novorossisk and proceed
thence overland to Ekaterinodar. I hardly think I
was repaid for my trouble, as the country through
which I passed was not of a very interesting
nature, and more like the neighbourhood of
Tumerūk than of Duapsè. At Novorossisk I
hired a cart (fourgon) with two horses and a driver
to take me to Ekaterinodar, calling at the Red
Forest <i>en route</i>. The distance was 114 versts, and
including stoppages, with the heavy cart behind
them, the game little horses did the journey in
thirty-three hours. It is wonderful what Russian
horses will do and on what a little food they do it.
Neither of the horses in this instance stood fourteen
hands, and they got no corn whatever on the
journey.</p>

<p>On our way to Ekaterinodar we stayed at a
large village called Krimsky&mdash;a Cossack settlement
I think it was originally; and here we encountered
another of those fairs at which the Russian moujik
buys and sells all he wants or wants to part with
during the year. I wandered into the fair whilst
the horses were being watered, and found it a
medley of every race in the Caucasus, distinguished
from one another not more by their varied and
picturesque costumes than by the endless variety of
their conveyances and beasts of burden. Fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
droshkies, droggies of rough logs tied together
with rope, lumbering fourgons, heavy ‘pavoshkas,’
light carts, like huge ozier baskets on
wheels, nearly six feet high, and the house on
wheels, which the Mingrelian calls his ‘arba,’ were
all ranged in rows to form the streets of the fair.
Round about them stood the beasts who drew
them, varying from a goat to a camel, from a pony
to a team of six grey oxen. The shops are simply
a sheet of canvas spread on the ground, perhaps
under a partially-inverted cart&mdash;some few under a
more pretentious awning; and here are laid out
the trader’s wares, whilst he for the most part sits
cross-legged in the midst. The grandest shops, or
booths rather, are generally those in which are sold
the ‘ikons,’ or holy pictures, for which there is an
immense sale amongst the pious Russian peasantry.
They are gaudy pictures of the Virgin, or one of
the saints, encased in a deep frame of brass, with
much tinsel and tawdry ornament about them;
but they are to be found in every moujik’s cottage,
and before them he pays his simple devotions to
his God, night and morning, standing bare-headed
with bent head, for barely a minute perhaps, but
apparently in earnest during that minute. A little
taper is kept always burning before the ‘ikon.’</p>

<p>Next to the ‘ikon’-seller, you detect by your
nose, if not by your eyes, the ‘shouba’-seller, for
these sheepskin garments are excessively strong-smelling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
even in their earliest stages. Close by,
in the midst of a crowd of the ugliest old women
on earth (and herein I do not malign the Russian
‘baboushka’), is a pedlar selling knitting-needles
and other housewife’s gear. They must be hard to
please from the noise they make, for the sound of
their bargaining would silence the morning babel
of Billingsgate.</p>

<p>At the back of the fair is a long row of fires on
the plain, whereat the Tartar is cooking the savoury
‘shushlik’ (kabob). This is the refreshment-stall
department of the fair, or at least a part of it; the
other part is to be found at the little square tables
at every corner, on which are a dirty bottle and
two dirtier glasses, behind which stands a red-shirted
moujik, and around him drunken Ivans
and Stepans embrace and fight, or argue and
abuse, for a Russian never fights as our English
rough does. Never, perhaps, is too strong a word;
but in my three or four years in Russia, though I
have known men dirked in broad daylight in the
bazaar, and have never entered a bazaar without
seeing one or two rows going on, I have not seen
two real stand-up fights. The Russian rough
barks loudly, and possesses a fathomless <i>répertoire</i>
of abuse, which he supplements with ready invention,
but he rarely goes beyond words. At these
tables too, ‘Macha,’ the demure peasant girl, as well
as the ‘staruka’ (crone), are frequently to be found;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and when they take their glass they take it neat as
the men do, and toss it off at one gulp as cleverly.
Russian peasant women are hard-working, frugal,
and the earliest risers in the world, being generally
up before dawn; but they are, alas! too often to be
found on their backs dead drunk in the street in
the morning. This is at least true of the Crimea
and Caucasus. I can only speak of what I have
seen.</p>

<p>At the Krimsky fair I discovered a show-booth,
and as show-booths are not every day
occurrences in such places, I proceeded to investigate
it. A rough tent, with strange pictures of
beasts roughly painted upon it, formed the abiding
place of the show. Round this a red-bearded
Persian continually prowled, with a long stick to
thump the heads of penniless brats who, unable
to pay for admission, kept trying to satisfy their
curiosity by furtively lifting a corner of the canvas
veil that concealed the mysteries within. Avoiding
this functionary’s stick, I paid twenty copecks
(about 6<i>d.</i>), and entered. There was one other
spectator besides myself, and, satisfied that this
was the largest audience he was likely to obtain,
the gentleman of the stick kindly followed me in
and prepared to perform, leaving the little boys to
see as much as they could meanwhile. In the
tent, in spite of all its grand advertisements, the
whole show consisted only of three small monkeys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
tied to a box, trying to get at the skins of two
maneless (Persian) lions, stretched on upright
sticks. These had been the glory of the show,
but had recently departed this life, leaving nothing
but the foolish-looking hides I now saw, to their
bereaved proprietor. After exhibiting some fire-swallowing
tricks, and a little serpent-charming,
the Persian announced the performance over; and
after disgusting him by showing him that I knew
all about the manner in which his deadly serpents
had been rendered harmless, I left hurriedly, lest a
worse thing should befall me.</p>

<p>My inspection of the fair was here cut short by
the arrival of my driver, announcing the horses
ready to proceed. I remarked that he seemed
anxious and mysterious in his manner, so followed
him quietly, and asked for explanations when we
got outside the town. Then he confessed that
lately two or three highway murders had been
committed near Krimsky; that the presence of such
a collection of roughs of every race as the fair contained
was not calculated to increase the safety of
the road, and that his reason for hurrying me out
of the fair was that he wished to leave unnoticed
before dark. From the time I left Krimsky to the
time that I reached Ekaterinodar I heard of nothing
but robberies and murders, several of which I
believe were substantially true, though that many of
them were exaggerated is only natural. But it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
hardly to be wondered at that there should be a
good deal of this kind of crime in such an uncivilised,
semi-settled district as the Caucasus, while
in the Crimea, which is far more civilised and
under the hand of the law, highway murders and
burglaries are not unknown even in the precincts
of the towns. The worst part of these highway
robberies on the Russian post-roads is that you
can never feel sure that your yemstchik is not in
league with the highwaymen; in fact, I have
heard Russians say that that was almost invariably
the case.</p>

<p>However, we reached our journey’s end unmolested;
grateful as far as I was concerned for
the only accident that occurred, as helping us more
rapidly on our way. This was merely a chase
given us by some infuriated moujiks, whose cart
we ran into and considerably damaged, when, as
usual in such cases, my yemstchik returned their
curses and sought safety in flight. Such a jolting
I never had before; but I forgave the cart even that,
as it got me into Ekaterinodar half an hour earlier
than I should have otherwise arrived.</p>

<p>To give some notion of the inexpensive nature
of travelling here, I may say that the sum I paid
the peasant for driving me the 114 versts from
Novorossisk was fourteen roubles, and this at the
then rate of exchange (ten roubles to the pound
sterling) would be 1<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> in English money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>. A
meal which I had on the way at the ‘duchan’ of a
small village we passed through, consisting of soup,
chicken, black bread and tea <i>ad libitum</i>, for my
man and myself, together with hay for the horses,
cost fifty-five copecks, <i>i.e.</i> about 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> Had I
travelled by post from Novorossisk, I should have
paid one-third less for my horses and travelled
faster, owing to the fact that I should have had
relays of horses and not the same pair the whole
way; but then I could not have gone out of the
direct course, or stopped where I liked.</p>

<p>Arrived at Ekaterinodar, I found myself in a
hot-bed of political discussion at the <i>table-d’hôte</i>,
where, amongst others, I met a certain Loris
Melikoff, a planter in the Caucasus, and brother,
I believe, to the dictator. Remembering Prince
Vorontzoff’s kindly advice, I carefully avoided
being drawn into the conversation as long as
politics were the subject, although some of the
things these half-educated officers were pleased to
say of England and her Premier (Lord Beaconsfield)
were hard to leave unanswered. They could
not, however, have paid him a greater compliment
than they involuntarily did by the hatred which
they expressed; and consoling myself with this
thought, I ate my dinner with an appetite unmarred
by the contempt which they were pleased to express
for a nation ruled by ‘a Jew.’ This was
everywhere the phrase which they hurled at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
head, considering it in our case a bitter disgrace that
our Prime Minister should be an alien, and totally
forgetting that not one officer of state only, but
two-thirds of their highest officials&mdash;in fact, almost
the entire brain of their country&mdash;are alien, and
principally of the race they most affect to hate, viz.
the Germans.</p>

<p>It may be readily imagined that I soon tired of
the society at the Petersburg Hotel, Ekaterinodar,
and indeed, early on the morning after my arrival,
I was at the treasury (‘kasnochest’) applying for a
travelling ticket. Of course I had to wait over
half an hour, while half a sheet of paper was being
filled in with a few signatures and my own name,
and during that time I had an opportunity of observing
some of the noticeable features in this
public office. Most of the clerks were smoking
cigarettes (those who were not had probably no
tobacco); none of them used blotting-paper, but
instead either blotted their manuscript on the
white-washed walls or sprinkled it with sand from
one of the many old sardine-boxes, supplied apparently
by a frugal government to contain that
valuable commodity. All expectorated with the
freedom and frequency, if not with the accuracy, of
the proverbial Yankee. Almost every clerk had
some decoration, and all were in uniform.</p>

<p>But the ‘podorojna’ was ready at last, and armed
with it I started once more for Kertch. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
road the relays of horses were scarcer than usual,
and in one place I was warned that at the next
station there was only one relay, and congratulated
by the postmaster (an old acquaintance) on being
in time to get it. As he spoke, a Russian officer
with a similar pass to mine and having heard the
same story from the yemstchiks, made vigorous
efforts to get off first and secure it. In this he
failed, and I started with a lead of half a verst or
more. But in a short time he came in sight, and
to my horror I found he had, by paying extra,
obtained another horse, thus driving four to my
three, a serious advantage over these fearfully heavy
roads.</p>

<p>The course was a long one, nearly twenty
versts, and by promising my driver a large ‘pour-boire’
if we were in first, I so roused him that
before ten versts were done our rival was again out
of sight. As darkness had set in, I made myself
as cozy as I could on my bundle of straw, and
thanks to long practice slept none the worse for
the jolting.</p>

<p>I woke with a start. Those confounded bells
that the horses wear seemed to surround me; for
whilst my own horses were shaking them furiously
in front in a last desperate struggle to keep the
lead, my rival’s four-in-hand was jingling them
triumphantly just behind, as he momentarily
gained on us. It was no good, our horses were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
dead beat, and every effort they made almost pulled
the wheels off in the heavy clay. The four passed
us in the darkness with a jeer from their yemstchik.
But they too had had enough of it, and as
the lights of the post-station were now in sight,
they were content to keep just in front of us, going
like ourselves almost at a foot pace.</p>

<p>A bright idea struck me. The first ‘podorojna’
presented gets the team, if both ‘podorojnas’ are of
equal urgency, and there is only one team to have.
We were now not many hundred yards from the
station. Touching my driver on the back, I told
him to take no notice of me: so ridding myself of
my wraps, with the travelling ticket in my hand, I
slipped off the tarantasse into the mud, and making
a considerable detour to escape observation&mdash;which,
owing to the darkness and the triumphant security
of the others, was not difficult&mdash;I ran my best, and
arriving considerably before the Russian officer,
handed in my ‘podorojna,’ and had the yemstchik
out after the fresh team before my rival entered the
office. When he met me coming out his face was
good to behold; but when I had explained how
I had done him, he took his beating like a man,
and invited me to share his basket of provisions
and a bottle of wine before parting company. I
hope he had not long to wait for horses.</p>

<p>On the steamer which took me from Taman to
Kertch was a cargo of fish for the Kertch bazaar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
caught in the lake between Taman and Tumerūk.
They were for the most part carp, huge fellows
weighing from 25 to 30 lbs., and one of the fishermen
told me they were frequently caught up to
40 lbs. in weight. There were sturgeon too, from
the mouth of the Kuban, caught, so they said, in
snares, something after the fashion of our ordinary
rabbit snares, as they routed with their noses pig-like
along the bottom of the stream. There were
too ‘sudak’ (Sandre), an excellent fish for the table,
and the hideous ‘som’ (Silurus)&mdash;largest, I believe,
of Caucasian fresh-water fishes. This whiskered
water-fiend plays the part of the pike in the Caucasian
lakes and rivers, feeding on all other fish,
and anything else in fact that he can find. From
what I have seen I should say the pike was rare in
the Caucasus, having only once seen one, and that a
very small specimen, near the Caspian. The ugliness
of the ‘som’ has led the inventive mind of the Russian
moujik to create all sorts of legends regarding
him, such as his laying hold of the limbs of horses
and cattle as they crossed fords near which he was
lying; and even of his seizing, and thereby drowning,
a man under similar circumstances. They tell
too of his growing to vast proportions; one Russian
colonel, whose home is in the Red Forest,
claiming, and being commonly reported, to have shot
one with his rifle while basking in the Kuban,
where it passes through the Crasnoi Lais, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
weighed over 200 lbs. I fear this sounds very
much like fisherman’s weight. What other wonderful
stories of the monsters of lake and river I
might not have heard, I cannot tell, for here the
steamer was made fast to the Kertch jetty, and
amongst the hearty congratulations of half a dozen
friends, my second tour in the Caucasus came to a
happy end.</p>

</div>

<p>I arrived at Kertch in an opportune moment, for
on the day of my arrival the little town welcomed
back one of its heroes in the Turkish war, and as
he was an old friend of mine, I came in for my
share of the merry-making. My friend and I were
invited to a large supper-party, composed of all the
young blood of Kertch, and were together fêted,
he as warrior, I as sportsman, both fresh from a
common field of glory (and discomfort) in Asia.</p>

<p>Of the Turkish war our friend had little to say,
except that the discomfort had seemed to him
greater than the danger, as the Turks were execrable
marksmen with the rifle, and though capital
artillerymen, none of their shells would explode.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
This I have heard frequently both before and
since.</p>

<p>The arrival of the old steamship ‘Kotzebul’ on
Sunday put an end to all these gaieties as far as
I was concerned; and leaving behind me a whole
mass of invitations unaccepted from my hospitable
friends at Kertch, I once more sailed for the Caucasus.</p>

<p>From Kertch to Poti we had a fair and pleasant
voyage, over a sea calm and still as an inland lake,
past a coast where mountains in the background
sink into hills in the foreground, and the hills
themselves run right down into the sea; while
almost from the point where they touch the waves
with their feet the forest starts upwards and clothes
them to the very summit. On November 26, at
Sukhoum, the skies were blue and cloudless, many
of the trees still in their green foliage, some double-petalled
wild roses in full bloom, and the temperature
that of an English summer.</p>

<p>Sukhoum itself though, in spite of the lovely
weather, is but a sorry sight. The houses are most
of them ruins; the town is full of soldiers camping
amongst the ruins and making confusion
worse confounded; the gardens are already half
absorbed in the wild growth that surrounds them;
the splendid avenues of ‘bignonia catalba’ which
once graced the town have been ruthlessly cut
down, though useless I should think even for firewood;
there is no church left, and I saw very few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
women. The streets are overgrown everywhere
with belladonna, one of the commonest weeds here.
But whilst meditating over the desolation of Sukhoum,
and gathering its wild roses, the whistle of
the steamer broke unpleasantly on my ear, and my
friend and myself had the nearest escape of being
left behind for a week, by the end of which time we
should have had enough of Sukhoum I think.</p>

<p>On board the steamer I met a certain Col. G., a
very well-known and successful sportsman, not only
in the Caucasus but throughout Russia. He had
spent three years between Elbruz and Sukhoum,
and had devoted a great deal of his time to sport,
but admitted that he knew very little of the country
yet. It was his opinion that this district is richer
in game than any other part of the country; and if
by game you mean only large game, I entirely
agree with him. In this comparatively small area
he himself had either shot or seen shot aurochs (bos
urus), ‘ollen’ (Russian red deer), roebuck, ibex,
chamois, wild goat, mountain sheep (tûr), leopards,
lynxes, otters, bears (of which he too said there
were at least two kinds), jackals, and here, and here
only, the black wolf. This is a beast of which I
have heard frequent mention on the Black Sea
coast, but have never seen it. It is probably only a
slight variety of the ordinary animal, but I think,
from frequent mention made of it, that it must be
a variety which is more or less prevalent in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
country. The best place for aurochs now is
between the Pscebai and upper Zelenduk rivers,
according to my friend. Col. G. told me of another
animal, which he declares exists in the Caucasus on
the Kuban river, to wit the beaver; but as I never
heard of this creature’s existence there from any of
the natives of the Kuban districts, or from any
naturalist, Russian or other, whom I have since
met, I think this last statement of the gallant
colonel’s must be taken ‘cum grano salis.’</p>

<p>Arrived at Poti, I found a very fair hotel for
such a town, managed by an obliging old Frenchman;
and though Poti is built on an undrained
swamp, I escaped without the fever. I was met
at Poti by an Englishman, who was at that time
acting vice-consul for Great Britain, and was himself
employed as agent to a large timber firm in England.
To this gentleman, Mr. Carroll, I owe
many thanks for his useful hints for my journey.
The timber of which he exports most from the
Black Sea coast, is, he tells me, box, of which large
quantities are found in the adjacent forests; and
the burr of the walnut-tree, an excrescence in
appearance rather like a huge fungus, but hard and
of most beautifully grained wood, out of which the
thin layers are cut, which are used in England for
veneering, etc. The cost of finding and transporting
these woods from the forests in the interior
of the Caucasus, between which and Poti communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
is difficult, renders them extremely
expensive.</p>

<p>From Poti to Tiflis I had two English-speaking
fellow-travellers&mdash;a German landowner and an
English mining engineer going to the former’s
property near Kutais to prospect for coal, of
which there is supposed to be a large supply there.
The coal, they say, is of good quality and in seams
of considerable thickness. This engineer, who had
seen a great deal of the Caucasus, assured me, in
common with many others, that though not in
sufficiently large quantities to be of any serious
importance, there was undoubtedly gold in most
of the small river beds between Batoum and
Duapsè. From Poti to Rion the scenery is not
very attractive, the first part being merely a
cutting through a marsh forest, where all the
growth is too rank, and so dense as to spoil the
individual development of the trees which compose
it: it has consequently a mean, stunted appearance&mdash;besides
looking horribly suggestive of fever.
At Rion, however, we were cheered by the sight
of glorious snow-capped peaks in the distance;
and here, having met with a Government forester,
to whom I told my story of wanderings in search
of game, I was by him persuaded to stay and
shoot for a few days in the neighbourhood of
Kutais.</p>

<p>After unearthing the local forester, whose senior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
my friend was, we prepared ourselves for any
emergency, by a liberal consumption of the inevitable
tea and ‘papiros’ (cigarette), and then drove to
an estate of Prince Mirsky’s, where we passed the
night. In the morning we had a game drive, and
killed a few roe deer, of which, Tartar fashion,
these fellows eat the kidneys, still warm and raw,
as soon as the beast was killed. I had the good
fortune to kill a very large wolf as my own share
of the bag, and a very handsome fellow he appeared
when I first saw him, with his fore feet planted on
an old stump and his hackles all up, looking
savagely over his shoulder in the direction of the
yelping curs which had disturbed him. He seemed
a good deal more inclined to fight than to run, I
thought. His coat was of that strange colour that
I have so often noticed in the hares of the Crimea
about the same time of year&mdash;a silver grey, turning
at different points to what you might almost call
rose pink.</p>

<p>Thanking my friends for the sport, and reflecting
that an utter stranger in England would be very
unlikely to meet with such random hospitality, I
resumed my journey to Tiflis next day. The
second half of the journey is far more interesting
than the first, and in places the scenery reminds
the traveller of Switzerland. The old town of
Suram is one of the most picturesque glimpses on
the way,&mdash;a huge ruin of a rough kind of castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
standing on a little eminence, with the cottages of
its dependent town brooding, chicken-like, under
the shadow of its wing. The station, which is the
end of the railway journey from Poti to Tiflis, is
by no means Tiflis, as I found to my cost, but is
put as far from the outskirts of the German colony,
which forms a continuation of Tiflis beyond the
Kûr, as it well could be. Tiflis, even by starlight,
after a long, dull journey, and seen from a droshky,
is a sight not to be forgotten. You feel in a
moment that the town you are now in is as distinct
from any you have ever seen before as anything
well can be. In spite of the Grand Duke’s presence
and the sober little German colony, European
civilisation is still only a resident stranger in the
streets of Tiflis. The Tartar, Georgian, and
Persian are all natural, and in keeping with the
place, but the occasional high hat of Bond Street
persuasion or Russian uniform is entirely out of
harmony with the surroundings.</p>

<p>As we crossed the Kura bridge we were met by
a long string of camels, and I was much impressed
by my first meeting with these weird, soft-footed
monsters, pacing through the silent starlit street,
with their heads almost on a level with the roofs
of the one-storied houses on either side, every
now and then giving a low roar, but save for this
moving on between bales like little towers, mute
and noiseless as ghosts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>On this, my first night at Tiflis, I had little
time to spend in admiring or wondering at the picturesque
medley of men and things all round me.
All my time was more than filled with hotel hunting.
Not a single hotel in the town had a room
unoccupied, though I tried more hotels in that one
night in Tiflis than I ever imagined the whole
Caucasus possessed collectively. The cause of this
was simply that the Lord Lieutenant was about to
leave Tiflis next morning, and all the gay world
of the Caucasus was in town to bid him farewell.</p>

<p>At last I found a resting-place in the worst
inn’s worst room, high up next to the rafters that
supported the roof, without any furniture, even the
bed being represented only by the post-house couch,
two feet too short for my legs. However, if my
room had its disadvantages by night, it had its
advantages by day, for in the morning the view
from my fourth story (the only fourth story, I
should think, in Tiflis) was superb.</p>

<p>The town lies clustered round the banks of the
river Kûr, a broad stream, with steep banks where
it passes through the town. Over its dark waters
rise tiers of flat-topped houses with external balconies,
where the ladies take the air and smoke
their cigarettes in the summer evenings, if their
husbands cannot afford to take them to the fashionable
summer resort of Tiflis in the hills. Here and
there fine modern buildings of European character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
mar the uniformly Asiatic nature of the scene,
while in the streets splendid carriages run into
rough log-carts on huge wooden wheels dragged
slowly along by half-tamed buffaloes. Camels
look pityingly down at you with mild, sad eyes,
as they stalk past; Cossacks and gentlemen in the
latest Parisian costume jostle each other on the
pavement; at the street corners sit ferocious figures
with moustaches several inches long, in sheepskin
headgear, literally one-fourth the size of themselves,
engaged in the peaceful occupation of embroidering
slippers or cushions, which are afterwards
exposed for sale in Abkhasian serais standing
side by side with shops wherein the wares are
fresh from the boulevards of Paris; and everywhere
throughout this strange scene glide the
Georgian women in their white mufflers, which
resemble nothing so much as a sheet wound round
their persons, showing only their faces and a few
inches of many-coloured skullcap at the top. Here
and there you see a Tiflis water-carrier with his
skins of precious fluid carried on his horse’s back;
a Persian selling hawks, or a band of Swanetian
minstrels in skullcaps of white felt. However,
when I first looked out from my lofty post of
vantage on the morning after my arrival, Tiflis
was but barely awake, and the sights I have
described above were only partly visible; the rest
gradually appeared as the day got older.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>As I sat on my balcony at six o’clock in the
morning, with my glass of tea and that leathery
ring of bread they call a ‘bublik,’ which forms
the regular breakfast of a Russian, the only things
stirring in the streets below were the ‘dworniks’
(watchmen), and a few lumbering peasants’ carts
coming into the bazaar. I was thankful, when
the day grew older and the streets more lively,
to leave my room and go in search of something
more like an English breakfast, before beginning
the business of the day; and though I had
some difficulty in getting the waiter to supply me
with anything more solid than aërated bread at
such an early hour, I did eventually succeed in a
capital hotel (the name of which I am sorry to have
forgotten), which I thenceforth made my home.</p>

<p>My first business was, of course, to find out our
English consul&mdash;a duty which, if travelling Englishmen
always observed, would conduce materially
to their comfort. It is besides a piece of courtesy
which ought not to be neglected. To a Londoner,
who does not know the way to any place, the first
thing that suggests itself is to hail a cabman, whom
he looks upon as an unfailing pilot. Acting on this
belief in the unerring topographical knowledge of
the race of Jehus, I hailed a droshky, and having
carefully explained to the driver where I wanted
to go, sank back in the cab, giving myself up in
perfect trust to the guidance of my pilot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
rapidly forgetting everything but the scene in the
streets we were passing through. A more perfect
<i>mélange</i> than Tiflis is impossible. There are no
two houses alike; there are no two groups of gossipers
by the way speaking the same dialect; in
every street there are a score of costumes belonging
to different nationalities; and, as I afterwards found
out, you can, by leaving these main thoroughfares,
dive into yet another world and a worse Babel, by
turning down towards the river and entering the
bazaar.</p>

<p>Shops there seemed to be many and good; one
of the best in the place being kept by a Scotchman.
The most attractive to the European are
those in which they sell Persian work, cushions,
carpets, and arms. In making purchases in these,
it is as well, however, to take a friend with you,
who knows something of the wares offered for sale,
as well as their approximate value, and the tricks
of their vendors. By doing this I certainly in purchasing
things to fit up a smoking-room at home
spent barely 100<i>l.</i> in place of about 250<i>l.</i>, the sum
to which the original demands of the tradesmen for
each separate item would have amounted. Nothing
annoys a foreigner more, I think, than this enforced
haggling over the price of every purchase.</p>

<p>But to hark back to my cabman. After driving
me all over Tiflis, through the main street, up
back slums that finally ended in waste hillside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and into squares which had no exit, and contained
nothing but shops on a kind of second story&mdash;after
hailing and haranguing some dozens of passers-by&mdash;he
pulled up, and told me with much complacency
there was no English consul, but that he would
find me two or three other consuls, French, German,
&amp;c., if they would do as well. For a moment
I was puzzled what to do, as my hotel-keeper had
been unable to give me the address I wanted, and
I hardly knew where else to ask for it now my
Jehu had failed me. But a telegraph-post gave
me an inspiration. Where those tall slim posts
are, there must be an Englishman or a German
not far off; and telling my cabby to drive to the
telegraph station, I soon found all I wanted, as
well as a kind friend in the person of the chief of
the telegraphists, Herr Günzel.</p>

<p>Our consul, I found, was just the man to help
me&mdash;an old Indian officer and shikaree, to whom
all my wants were perfectly comprehensible. To
Captain Lyall I owe much for his ever-ready help
and hospitality. With him and Herr Günzel I
passed the next few days, calling upon the dignitaries
of Tiflis, presenting my letters of introduction,
and obtaining all the information I could
collect relative to Lenkoran and the game to be
found there.</p>

<p>With one solitary exception (Prince Gagarin,
once governor of the Lenkoran district) I was told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
by every one that large game abounded, and tigers
were things of everyday occurrence. Alas! I listened
to the many, and, in spite of my own conscience,
closed my ears to the one. One Russian
gentleman upon whom I called showed me a letter
just received from an Englishman engaged in
writing a monograph on crocuses, asking for his
assistance to obtain certain bulbs of this flower
supposed to exist at Lenkoran. I did my best,
as I promised my friend I would do, to obtain some
bulbs during my stay by the Caspian; but as there
were no leaves above ground, and as the natives
don’t take any notice of flowers, or know one from
another, I was completely foiled in my attempt.</p>

<p>The number of musical instruments in the
streets of Tiflis would lead one to believe that the
population is a most musical one. My old enemy,
the barrel-organ, turned up here in great force,
especially about the German colony. The Armenians
seem most fond of it, and during my short
stay in Tiflis I twice saw a droshky containing a
couple of Armenians evidently on the spree, with
organ and organ-grinder crowded in on the top of
them, playing away his hardest, while, with beaming
faces which plainly testified that they were
doing the correct thing according to their lights in
the best style, they rattled through the streets.
Those who know these people will tell you that it
is their favourite folly, when they have had a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
too much to drink, to engage an organ-grinder by
the day, drive him about playing over them, until
they have called at so many ‘cabaks’ on the way
as to render their seats in the droshky insecure,
and then, alighting at their favourite drinking-den,
enthrone their grinder on the table round which
they sit, and to the tunes of their beloved instrument
succumb gloriously to the united charms of
Bacchus and Apollo.</p>

<p>Next morning they go home from the gutter
with a consciousness of having spent a happy day,
as a happy day ought to be spent, and regard its
memory as a thing to be proud of. It seems a
strange thing, but in Russia and amongst these
people the peasants envy a drunkard instead of
pitying him. Drunkenness is to them a highly
desirable condition, and shame for it they cannot
understand. The most popular Englishman who
ever lived and travelled amongst the Caucasian
tribes owed his popularity entirely to the enormous
quantity of strong drink he could absorb without
doing himself any harm. The Circassians themselves
have an almost incredible facility for drinking
large quantities of wine without any apparent harm.</p>

<p><i>A propos</i> of wine, the wine of the country, or
rather one of the wines of the country, the Kachketinsky
wine, both red and white, is admirable,
and far superior to any of the imported wines to
be met with at Tiflis. There is another wine which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
is a good deal drunk by the ladies, called ‘Donskoi.’
It is something like Moselle, red in colour and
unbearably sweet to the palate. The people drink
vodka and rough native wine in their ‘cabaks’ and
‘duchans,’ as well as a rough kind of beer, very sweet,
and more like what mead must have been than like
any beer of to-day. Tiflis itself is full of beer-halls,
but these are rather for the military and the
Germans than for the natives. These Germans
are, I fancy, an unpopular race in the Caucasus as
well as in Russia, not from any inherent vice in
their natures, but from the fact that, being more
civilised than their neighbours, they utterly refuse
to mix with them, living apart in their colonies,
with their own society, school, and church, prospering
beyond any other settlers, and by their staid
sobriety and orderly, thrifty life, forming a contrast
to the life around them too favourable to themselves
to be pleasing to their neighbours. ‘Nemets’
and ‘colbasnik’&mdash;dummy and sausage-eater&mdash;are
the sobriquets in which they rejoice.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after my arrival at Tiflis the
town, in spite of its novelty and ever-varying
scenes, began to pall upon me, and with some
difficulty I arranged a shooting expedition to the
neighbouring steppe of Kariâs. Here the Grand
Duke holds his shooting parties, and enormous are
the bags made, though the festivities are of such a
nature as one would imagine to interfere considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
with the shooting. But, alas! for us,
there were to be no royal forests with innumerable
beaters and any quantity of boars and tall red
deer. Our hunting grounds were the wide steppelands
outside the viceregal preserves, where antelopes
(<i>subgutturosæ</i>) and all the ruffians who are
wanted by the Government at Tiflis do mostly
congregate.</p>

<p>Early, then, in the morning, while the stars
were making up their minds to retire for the day,
and a faint pink was just stealing into the sky,
our party rattled out of Tiflis; the English consul
and myself on horseback, the rest of our party on
wheels. Our way lay through the Tartar bazaar,
where the fiery-bearded Persians and astute Armenians
were already astir, and then over the broad
Kûr, and through lands which but for the artificial
irrigation of which the Kûr is the source
would be absolutely barren. On our road we met
a quaint cavalcade, if that may be called a cavalcade
which contained but one horse: a vast train
of donkeys, some brown, some white, several
hundreds in number, part bearing bales of merchandise,
and part their owners. Here and there
amongst the troop a black conical tent ambled along,
nothing visible but the tent with four thin legs
trotting along under it. This was a Tartar or
Persian on his donkey, his ‘bourka’ round his neck,
hanging in loose folds to his animal’s knees, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
completely concealing man and beast. The caravan
was on its way to Persia, and was the only one
of the kind I ever saw, though trains of camels and
carts are of frequent occurrence between Batoum
and Tiflis.</p>

<p>Kariâs, or the black summer, is a name which
this steppeland has earned for itself by the excessive
virulence of the fever which raged there after the
introduction of artificial irrigation. It is some
thirty-five or forty versts from Tiflis, and, besides
being the preserve of the Grand Duke and the
refuge of Tiflis outlaws, it is the home of several
bands of Tartars and one German planter.</p>

<p>It was to the home of this latter that we turned
our horses’ heads, after being ferried over the broad
dark waters of the Kûr. All the road between
Tiflis and this ferry had been bare and uninteresting:
low grey hills, looking parched and lifeless
on our right, a grey dusty steppe at our feet, and
on our left the bare unlovely banks of the Kûr,
with here and there a huge vulture sitting gorged
and sullen on its shore. By the ferry a belt of low
woodland lent some interest to the scene; but this
was left behind as soon as the river was crossed;
and far away on every hand stretched the level
steppeland, so bare of succulent herbage as to
appear anything but pleasant pastures for the
many flocks of sheep and herds of antelope that
roam over its surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour’s ride, straining our eyes in a vain
endeavour to catch a first glimpse of the antelopes,
whose home we were invading, brought us to a
canal with a bridge and toll-house or something
of that nature; and the bridge once crossed, the
clamour of a dozen curs and the appearance of
several Tartars advised us of our arrival at our
journey’s end. The planter himself came to meet
us&mdash;a young fellow speaking many languages as
well as his own, a mere boy amongst the worst-looking
gang of labourers man ever put eyes upon,
yet managing them fairly well, and making his
venture pay. His home was a mere hut, utterly
destitute of any of the comforts or refinements of
that civilisation to which he had apparently been
brought up; and it would indeed need to be a
lucrative venture which should tempt a man to
lead the life our friend Adolphe led. He had been
made a magistrate by the Tiflis Government, with
exceptional powers and privileges; but, as he himself
told us, he was a magistrate merely in name,
unable to carry out any measure he might deem
necessary, utterly powerless to punish or bring to
punishment, and so used to the evils by which he
was surrounded as to have grown perfectly callous
to them. Murder, horse-stealing, and every other
crime are of almost daily occurrence. However
openly committed, it is impossible to convict, as
none dare witness against the perpetrators of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
crime, knowing full well that, should they do so,
they would live in hourly danger of their lives from
that time forth. And even in the rare cases in
which the crimes have been fully proved, and the
criminals safely conveyed to Tiflis, they have been
set free again on one plea or another, until the
name even of justice has lost all meaning in the
land. In the six or seven years during which my
host has lived at Kariâs he has had his horse shot
under him on one occasion, has had a bullet put
through his bourka on another, and on a third,
whilst riding into Tiflis, a bullet fired from the
rifle of a concealed assassin broke the jaw of the
servant who accompanied him. If he makes himself
obnoxious to any of his neighbours in the
execution of his magisterial duties, his best horses
are mutilated, his cattle shot, or his house fired.
Labour is so dear and labourers so scarce that he
cannot afford to choose those he employs, and
though a man comes to him red-handed, he must
engage him and be content. Thus it happens
that his own men are the veriest scum of Tiflis.</p>

<p>One fellow who acted as my guide was wanted
by the Tiflis police for murder, and a speech made
by my host himself illustrated, I thought, as well
as anything could, the utter lawlessness of Kariâs.
‘We generally have mutton,’ he said, ‘though, as I
have no sheep and don’t buy it, I don’t know where
it comes from; some of my fellows steal it, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
suppose.’ Raids upon sheep and cattle are of common
occurrence, and free fights take place between the
villages. The cattle stolen are generally driven across
the river and sold at Elizabetpol. Every village
is, I believe, theoretically responsible for the misdoings
of each of its inhabitants; and thus a man’s
neighbours are to some extent converted into amateur
policemen, who watch and report his deeds.
But as a crime is rarely the result of one individual’s
enterprise, the culprit is rarely run to ground; and
even if he is, the village pays an inadequate fine,
and there is an end of it.</p>

<p>Tiflis itself is under military law, and at the
moment when I left it for Kariâs three men were
under sentence of death for a glaring outrage committed
in broad day in the streets. Two were
to be hanged, and one, in consideration of his
rank as a nobleman, though filling a menial position,
was to be shot.</p>

<p>But the stories of the lawlessness of the Caucasus
might be continued <i>ad infinitum</i>, were it not
that they would become monotonous, and, as our
consul himself remarked, the state of the country
is so bad that an honest account of it would not
find credence in England. I am tempted to say
more on this subject than I might otherwise have
done, because travellers who have recently written
on the Caucasus, having kept much to the post-roads,
and, luckily, escaped molestation upon them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
have, I think, given too peaceful a colouring to their
picture of the country through which they drove.
In another place I may be able to say more of the
safety of the Russian post-roads.</p>

<p>That the fever from which Kariâs derived its
evil name was of an exceedingly virulent nature
may be imagined from the fact that in one summer,
out of a village of three hundred inhabitants,
only nine were left alive. The whole place seems
plague-stricken in summer, even the river having
its disease, in the shape of a small worm, which,
burrowing into the skin of those who bathe in
it, eats away whole joints, until the part affected
has the appearance of being withered. One man
amongst those we saw at Kariâs had a withered
finger-joint, which he attributed to this cause.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock we rolled ourselves up in
our bourkas, thanking our stars that we were not
settlers in the Kariâs steppe, though as a hunting-ground
it is in every way desirable. Before turning
in we were warned that we ought to be up early,
and, thanks to the too lively nature of our couches,
we were up long even before we need have been.
At one o’clock the misty air feels chill and comfortless;
we were glad to busy ourselves vigorously
in preparing our horses for the day’s sport;
and, though we felt like blind men following the
blind, we blundered on at a quick step after our
guide into the darkness that encircled us. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
going some three versts, that seemed to us thirty,
we took our guide’s advice, and, hobbling our
horses, rolled ourselves in our bourkas, to lie
waiting in the dark until the dim light stealing
over the plains should show us the antelopes
browsing within rifle-shot. But all our dreams
had to be of the waking sort, for the intense chill
made it too cold to sleep, and, though the grey
dawn showed us no confiding herds, it was none
the less welcome on that account.</p>

<p>Gradually around us there grew out of the
darkness a plain flatter than all fancy can fashion,
with never a tree nor a bush to break the monotony,
or to afford concealment to any living thing.
Round this there rose slowly on the sight a chain
of low hills, with the river and the low mountains
running at right angles to them; and on the other
two sides steppe unbroken to the horizon. And
now we rose and shook away the chill and the
torpor it had brought into our blood, and with
a pang of regret for that tub which circumstances
so often denied, we buckled our bourkas on to our
horses, slipped cartridges into our rifles, and spreading
out into line, shaped our course across the still
dim steppe for the low hills beyond.</p>

<p>As the dawn brightened we began to fancy
ghost-like figures flitted away over the horizon into
the unseen beyond, and at last we made out clearly
a herd of some thirty antelopes. As they scudded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
with short stiff tails erect over the plains&mdash;their
horns for some reason unnoticeable in the distance&mdash;they
looked to me quaintly like large grey dogs,
with none of the deer-like attributes with which
fancy had endowed them. Once we had found
one band, the whole plains seemed to be alive with
them, racing about from point to point or standing
rigidly at gaze. To see them and to long for a
nearer view was one thing, to obtain that view
quite another. Fired at continually by the Tartars,
hunted by the sheepdogs, though little hurt
by either, they were as shy as any living thing
could be. Stalking them was out of the question,
and they made all attempts to surround them
futile by breaking through the line almost before
it began to close in on them. Nearer than five
hundred yards we seemed doomed never to get, and
after half a day’s ceaseless fag and a few wild shots
at impossible ranges, my friend L. got disgusted,
gave it up, and went home.</p>

<p>Towards mid-day we reached the low hills
which bounded the plain on the side farthest from
the canal and our home, and in my eagerness to
secure an antelope I found I had lost sight of my
companions with the horses. This troubled me
very little, as I knew the way back; and if I did not
find my friends before nightfall I felt quite capable
of getting back on foot.</p>

<p>All over these plains near Tiflis, and in fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
near any town in the Caucasus, large flocks of
sheep are pastured; at Kariâs their shepherds are
Tartars, whose pens and huts are in the low hills,
at whose foot I had now nearly arrived; but that
I did not know till later. Whilst still half a mile
from the hills, I noticed a large herd of antelopes
galloping for a point, to gain which they had to
cross my line of march about a quarter of a verst
in front of me. The herd looked as if it had been
recently fired at, and some of its members were
far behind the leaders, who had already crossed
me. Hoping that these laggards would not perhaps
swerve from the line of the rest, I ran as hard
as I could to intercept them, and was rewarded by
two long shots, which apparently did not tell.</p>

<p>Though the shots did not affect the antelopes
they led me into a most unpleasant adventure.
Browsing at some distance was an immense flock
of sheep, and at the sound of my rifle a dozen of
the huge grey dogs who guard these flocks came
racing towards me, loudly manifesting their displeasure
at my presence as they came. Often
before had I been annoyed by these gaunt beasts
in the Crimea and elsewhere, and even known them
board a traveller’s cart as it passed through one of
the Tartar villages they infested, but never before
had I seen them look so much in earnest as they
did to-day. They were all round me in a minute;
and though still preserving a discreet distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
deafened me with their hideous din, and resolutely
baffled all my attempts to break through their circle.
Picking up some stones, I tried to free myself in
that way from my tormentors, without any result,
until a larger stone than the rest caught one of their
number on the leg, and set him howling lustily.</p>

<p>Then the shepherds, who up till that moment
had been enjoying the baiting of a stranger from
the far distance, utterly careless of what might
happen to the victim, set up a shout, and leaving
their flock, one of them came towards the scene of
action. The shepherds’ shout acted in the most
inspiriting way on the attacking forces, which at
once closed in on me, one brute flying straight at
my throat, and meeting my rifle barrel full in his
teeth, while another wilier cur, taking me in rear,
made his teeth meet in one of the tendons behind
my knee. This was more than flesh and blood could
stand, so rather than be actually worried to death,
I pulled out my revolver and let drive into two of
my assailants; the brute who had bitten me from
behind getting the first bullet. This sent the
whole pack flying for the moment; so seizing the
opportunity before they had time to rally again, I
made for the shepherd, and being extremely savage
collared him somewhat roughly, and gave him to
understand that unless he called his brutes off and
kept them off as long as I was within rifle-shot, I
would put the next bullet into him. After a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
deal of talking and violent gesticulation, I limped
off, feeling much less sure of tramping gaily home
in case I did not find the horses than I did half an
hour before.</p>

<p>But my adventure was not to end here. For
some time I tried to stalk different herds along the
base of the hills, and was eventually led into the
hills themselves by an antelope which I imagined
was wounded. In following him I must have returned
to a point in the hills opposite to the scene
of my skirmish with the dogs; for before I knew
where I was I stumbled upon three Tartars sitting
round a fire, one of whom was my shepherd friend
of the morning. Seeing me they jumped up and
called to me to come to them. Their fire not being
in my course and my antelope still in sight, I kept
on my way. The request became a command; and
then seeing how the wind lay, I mentally consigned
them to a more tropical climate, and looked anxiously
out for the horses. As I did not come to
them, two of them came running to me, while the
third, from the top of the hill, sent out a signal-cry,
not unlike the Australian ‘cooey.’ My first thought
was to stand and fight, for their intentions were
obviously hostile; besides I knew that I should
be made to account for the damage I had done
their pack in self-defence that morning. But a
moment’s thought was enough to show me that
unless I meant to use my rifle, my chance against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
the four (for another appeared at once on the
scene) would be extremely poor; so with a good
start I took to my heels and ran. Up one hill and
over its brow into the valley that separated it from
another no bigger than itself,&mdash;from that to another
and a third, the chase went on&mdash;the pursuers
growing in numbers each time I looked back,
until, when quite blown, I stopped to see whether
my rifle would intimidate them, they had increased
to over a dozen. A shot from my rifle
did stop them for a moment or two; but before I
was well at the bottom of the hill from which I
fired I heard them coming on again. And here
I began to feel things were really extremely serious
for me. I had killed their dog&mdash;I had therefore
little mercy to expect from them. I was dead
beat, and my bitten leg made running all the more
difficult. I had only half a dozen cartridges with
me; and at the very best I could not hope to make
a good fight of it, so poorly furnished with ammunition,
against so many rascals with their blood
up, in a place where there was no stone or bush to
get behind. That they would make short work of
me if they caught me I had little doubt; the
quarrel would in their eyes justify any outrage,
and my good rifle be an additional incentive to
them to give me my quietus.</p>

<p>But here a double saved me. At the bottom
of the little hill I was still on was a wide earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
crack: into this I jumped, whilst my pursuers
were still on the other side of the summit, and following
the course of the chasm I doubled round
the base of the hill a little way and then waited.
Yelling like demons the Tartars came over the
hill, and to my infinite relief, supposing me probably
to have just topped the next rising ground,
redoubled their exertions to overhaul me in the
direction which they fancied I had taken. Once
safely past me, I turned and ran back on my track
for some distance, and then made for the plains. I
am thankful to say that there I found my friends
and the horses, and heard no more of either dogs
or Tartars.</p>

<p>It was now getting late in the day. My friend
G., disgusted with having toiled many hours and
taken nothing, returned to Adolphe’s. Being still
keen to secure at least one head as a souvenir of
Kariâs, I kept my horse and the guide, to make one
last effort before giving up the chase.</p>

<p>I had heard that by riding round and round a
herd in ever-narrowing circles, a shot might sometimes
be got from a nearer point than could otherwise
be hoped for. Determined to leave no stone
unturned to secure success, I tried this method,
and after riding enough useless circles to have made
both man and horse giddy, I at last got within four
hundred yards of a small herd, which, standing
with their heads up, were just preparing to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
away again, when, trusting rather to my aim on
foot than on horseback, I slipped out of the saddle,
and, allowing for the distance, fired at the nearest
buck. At the report the whole herd took to flight,
the animal shot at bringing up the rear. Hardly
hoping to effect anything, I fired again at him,
and that time thought I saw him stagger as if the
bullet struck him. But he recovered and went on;
and after catching my horse I rejoined my guide
and prepared to go home empty-handed.</p>

<p>On telling him, however, that I fancied I had
hit the last antelope I fired at, he insisted on following
the herd to see if we could not run down
the wounded beast, which he thought would not
go far. And he was right; for after a ride of less
than a mile the antelope lay down, and, to my
inexpressible delight, I was able to ride back with
a fine young buck on my saddle. Both bullets
had struck him behind, but had not smashed any
large bones. In spite of my hard day and my
swollen leg, that certainly was a moment of triumph
in which I deposited my hardly-earned game in
the midst of my half-incredulous friends. But
after the way of the world, having vehemently
assured me that if I worked for a week I should
never get an antelope without dogs to help me,
now, with the buck before them, they calmly insisted
that it was only the luck of a tyro, and
would be the first and last I should ever bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>We stayed one more day at Kariâs, encouraged
so to do by my success on the first day, and on
this second day I was again in luck, though for the
time I did not know it. After a long patient stalk,
by utilising the only bit of slightly rising ground
between myself and the horizon, I got within two
hundred and fifty yards of three antelopes feeding.
One of them, a splendid white-faced old buck, with
a beautiful head, stood at gaze, looking towards me,
and broadside on. I heard my bullet strike him
as plainly almost as if it had struck a ringing bull’s-eye,
and at that distance I expected to see him drop
in his tracks. For a moment he fell on his knees,
and then recovering, came straight towards my
place of ambush, passing me at a terrific pace not
more than thirty yards off. I fired the other barrel
at him, but though I aimed well in front, I saw the
bullet cut up the steppe in a line far behind him.
Had I had my horse with me I might have had a
chance; but as it was, though I ran some distance
on foot to see if my prize would not drop after
going a few hundred yards, I had to give it up,
and the last I saw of the antelope that day was as
he disappeared from sight with half a dozen sheepdogs
at his heels. He was found next day pulled
down and eaten by dogs or wolves; and luckily his
head, which my friend Lyall obtained for me, was
but little hurt. The ‘express’ bullet had caught him
full in the centre of the shoulder blade, splitting it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
right and left. How any beast contrived to go
as he did with such a wound I cannot understand.</p>

<p>Towards evening the antelopes, which had
been a good deal harassed the last day or two,
appeared to pack, and I once or twice came across
large herds, one of which must have numbered
from 150 to 300. These antelopes are, I believe,
not a common variety, being found only between
the Black Sea and the Caspian. The horns, which
are curved back from the brow, start away from
one another at the base, and curve in towards
each other again at the tips. They are annulated
from the base to the point at which the inward
curve commences. The finest head in my possession
has twenty-four rings on either horn, the horns
measuring fourteen inches each. In this specimen
the face is quite white from age, all the handsome
black and tan markings of the younger bucks
having faded out in this veteran. On my return
to Tiflis I made another discovery with regard to
this antelope, to wit, that of all the flesh I ever
ate, its flesh is the most delicious.</p>

<p>Like all other game, antelope is very cheap in
the bazaar; for though the Russians are far from
being great sportsmen, every peasant has a gun,
and dabbles in the chase for profit’s sake. Amongst
the Russians in the north I doubt not there are
many genuine sportsmen to be found&mdash;keen men,
who relish a hard day’s work with a spice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
danger in it, and who care very little for a large
bag if it is not owing mainly to their own skill
or exertions. But of the Russians whom I have
met in three to four years in the Crimea and
Caucasus, I cannot say so much. A Russian,
though he invariably has some chaff for an Englishman
on the score of tame pheasants, &amp;c., is
essentially either a pot-shot if a peasant, or a lover
of battues if he be a gentleman. At Kariâs (the viceregal
preserves) all the shooting is of the battue
order. At another great sporting centre in the
Caucasus, where a prince preserves the shooting
and wild sheep and chamois abound, even the
chamois are cleverly deluded into becoming victims
of a drive. Deer-stalking, as we understand
it, and chamois-hunting, as the hardy Swiss follow
it, is a sport unknown here, except to the Tartars
of Daghestan.</p>

<p>Although there is a plentiful supply of antelopes
near Tiflis, all those that find their way into
the bazaar are run down by mounted Tartars,
none being stalked by Russians.</p>

<p>And yet, after their own fashion, Russians are
very keen about sport. They love to organise a
party, and are extremely hospitable to the stranger
in making him one of it; but if that stranger be a
keen sportsman, and has his mind full of visions
of great game to be found and killed in their native
fastnesses, the sight of the enormous supplies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
food and wine deemed necessary for a three days’
campaign will strike despair into his heart. I am
sorry to have to say it, because some Russians
have been most kind to me; but a shooting expedition,
as a rule, means an excuse for extraordinary
eating and drinking, which is carried on at
such a rate that, spite of the enormous supplies,
the expedition generally has to return on the
second day, having consumed everything.</p>

<p>On my return from antelope-shooting at Kariâs
I had to spend four or five days at Tiflis as best I
could, waiting until my papers were all ready and
everything arranged for a start to Lenkoran.
Having left almost all my European clothing at
Kertch, I was hardly in a fit state to make much
use of my introductions, so I passed my time in
inspecting Tiflis and watching the life around me.
And my time, thus employed, did not hang very
heavily on my hands. First, there was the
Museum, where Professor Radde did the honours
in the most genial way, and added to the interest of
the collection by anecdotes of his travels on the
Amoor in the pursuit of his favourite study. The
arrangement of some of the groups of natural objects
is wonderfully artistic, the wild goats being represented
in natural attitudes on their native rocks,
and the vultures gorging on a dead camel in a way
that is almost too realistic. But one of the handsomest
things in the whole collection is a magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
chandelier of the horns of the ‘ollen’ (Russian
red deer) in the Professor’s dining-room. The
sight of this led to my being told that at Borghom,
the shooting-box of the Grand Duke, the whole of
the furniture throughout is made entirely of red
deer’s horns or other trophies of the chase.</p>

<p>After the Museum, the (to me) most interesting
sight was the Tartar bazaar. Here it was
my intention to purchase an entire native outfit in
which I might travel without exciting attention, as
I should have done had I worn European clothes,
were it only my moleskin shooting-jacket. Our
consul kindly volunteered to pilot me; but before
starting on such an errand as the one in hand, certain
preparations were necessary&mdash;amongst which
huge boots reaching above the knee, to enable us
to wade with comfort through the mud, and
old clothes on our backs to blind the avaricious
Armenians, were perhaps the chief. The Tartar
bazaar is a network of extremely narrow streets
lying near the Kûr, in which everything is sold
and every race assists in the selling. Each street
has its speciality: one is the bootmakers’ road,
another the silversmiths’ or armourers’; here only
vegetables and game are sold, there furs are the
only commodities exposed for sale. And this
system has its advantages, for you can in one
glance take in all the goods of any particular kind
which the bazaar contains. The whole choice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Tiflis is before you, and if the best there is not
good enough for you, you can get no better elsewhere.
But, on the other hand, the rivalry of the
different shopkeepers becomes first amusing, and
then distracting. At one moment you appear to
be in danger of being torn to pieces by contending
candidates for your custom; the next, there is
every prospect of a free fight among the rivals
themselves. But this gradually calms down; and
then sticking to one shop, you ask for what you
want. An article of the kind required is produced,
the worst probably in stock, and held up to your
eyes tenderly and admiringly by its owner, while
he pours forth its praises in the most glowing
terms of the East. You don’t like it, in spite of
its being fit for the Prophet to wear; you don’t
care about wearing it yourself, you want a better.
Well, heaven knows what will please the gentleman,
perhaps&mdash;and then as by inspiration the
merchant remembers some other specimen of the
article required, and producing it pours forth its
eulogy in terms ten times as glowing as those
which described the qualities of the first. This
goes on as long as you will stand it, and then with
a sigh the rascal produces something really worth
having. You decide that it will do for you, and
asking its price, are promptly told that to oblige
you the vendor will take double its marketable
value for it. My friend taught me the next step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
in the proceedings; and I must admit that it is a
vast improvement on the old system of haggling,
which requires half an hour at least to conclude.
It is simply to offer half the price asked, and being
refused, turn and walk deliberately out of the shop.
The tradesman will mark each yard of your retreat
by a fresh abatement of price or by specious offers.
Take no notice, but pursue your way in obdurate
silence, and the odds are ten to one that before you
are out of sight, a little boy will overhaul you and
bring you back to the shop to receive your purchase
at half price.</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities of the traders is, that
they are continually wanting to shake hands with
you, give you a cigarette, or otherwise scrape
acquaintance with their customer. As you stand
bargaining with them while they sit cross-legged
in their open shop front, they stop to call your
attention to one or other of the innumerable gamins
who infest the narrow thoroughfares of the bazaar,
begging for alms. These I believe are the children
of the shopkeepers, and you are expected to toss
them a copper for the pleasure of being swindled
by their father. These gamins of the bazaar are
an amusing race. Stunted, bright-eyed, and unboundedly
quick and bitter of tongue, they have
neither fear nor respect for their seniors. The lips
that a moment ago were fervently kissing your
hand for the copper you gave at their asking, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
at the next moment going at the rate of sixty
miles an hour in chaff and abuse of some greybeard
in collision with whom their owner has
come. Sometimes even I have seen the gamin go
the length of brickbats, but even this elicits but
little remark and no punishment. Some of the
Armenian youngsters were carrying on trade on
their own account, one child of twelve having a
shop of his own, and appearing no mean rival of
the older men around him. But these Armenians
begin life early and develop rapidly, passing from
babyhood to manhood at a bound. Their women
marry at twelve I am told, and I have frequently
seen Armenian girls who looked old enough for
anything at that age.</p>

<p>In one store kept by a Persian, I was immensely
amused by the owner’s admiration for the
beard of a German friend who was with me. It
was too droll to see the solemn red-bearded merchant
in his high conical hat of black felt tenderly
stroking the astonished German’s beard between
the palms of his hands. However, I believe my
friend’s beard produced such an impression, that
the carpets shown us were of the best, and the
prices asked not too exorbitant.</p>

<p>Throughout the bazaar the streets are so extremely
narrow that you could in many places
spring from one house to another across the street.
Everywhere the mud is more than ankle deep. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the street corners you are run over by rough carts
dragged creaking drearily along by grim-looking
buffaloes, and if you avoid this fate, a stalwart
waterman&mdash;with bare brown legs and a round skullcap
of white felt, with only one garment on, and
that all open at the chest, displaying a skin of red
copper colour, with a huge jar of terra-cotta on his
shoulder filled with the precious fluid which he so
seldom uses&mdash;will jostle and knock you down. Nor
must you lose your temper; for to strike or
roughly handle one of these gentry in their own
domains would be to call down the wrath of the
whole bazaar on your devoted head. Here they
have no notion of fair play, and in a moment you
would be hustled, beaten, stoned, and all as pitilessly
as a welsher on an English racecourse; and
if, half dead, you escaped without a knife between
your ribs, you might indeed think yourself
lucky.</p>

<p>The most interesting shops to me were the furriers,
in which I saw an enormous number of
lynxes’ skins, brought, so they said, from the Black
Sea coast; and the armourers’ shops, in which with
the roughest tools they executed most elaborate
and beautiful handles in silver and black for blades
of every quality and date.</p>

<p>Having purchased my costume and seen as
much of the bazaar as I cared to, I returned to
Tiflis proper, and here the streets were fast filling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
with the gymnasts returning from school. The
difference between a Russian gymnast and an
English schoolboy is as great as that between the
climates in which they live. Everywhere the Russian
gymnast has the same costume&mdash;a blue frock-coat
with brass buttons and a quasi military-peaked
cap. His whole bearing, however small he may be,
is that of a little old man, half soldier, half scholar,
and in all sedate and quite a man of the world.
He has, as far as I have seen, no games; bear-fighting
is unknown to him; that sterner kind of
fighting, which in English schooldays generally
takes place behind the chapel, is equally so; he
wears gloves if he can afford it, he speaks French,
and makes a poor imitation of French manners; he
is nearly as much addicted to spectacles as a German
student, is not the least bit shy in ladies’
society, and smokes with an easy grace that many
a freshman might envy. Poor fellow, his precocious
social qualities are dearly bought at the
sacrifice of all the merry, untamed roughness of the
English schoolboy.</p>

<p>Everywhere the streets teem with uniforms,
from that of the gymnast of eight years old to
that of the general of eighty. But be not alarmed,
pacific sojourner in the streets of Tiflis! Many, nay
most of these warlike-looking men are at least as
peaceable civilians as yourself. That gorgeous
apparel which you believe must cover the manly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
form of a dashing cavalry officer, is but the official
dress of a telegraphist or an apothecary’s clerk.
All those medals and orders adorn the breast,
not of a veteran general, but of a well-fed, contented
tailor. Why he got them he perhaps can
explain to you. I have seen the phenomenon of a
peaceable civilian’s breast blazing with brass plates
and orders at a Governor’s reception, but I never
could understand the cause of that phenomenon.</p>

<p>To atone for the warlike aspect of many of its
well-fed citizens, Tiflis presents to you, in common
with other towns in the Caucasus and Southern
Russia, some strangely domestic specimens of the
officer proper. Any day of the week you may
meet on the boulevard, with sword clanking by his
side and perhaps some fair dame with him, a young
dragoon in full uniform, with a poultice tied round
his neck, or a large white cloth bandaging his
manly cheeks to cure the faceache. Such a facecloth
we are accustomed to see round the scullery-maid’s
red face in England, but in full uniform it
seems a strange appendage to heroic youth.</p>

<p>The Russians are a hopeless puzzle to a foreigner.
They stringently prohibit the importation of the
most harmless foreign newspaper, erasing whole
passages in any sent to residents amongst them
by post; and yet Mr. Grenville Murray’s book,
‘Russians of To-day,’ is allowed to be sold, and has
had such a rapid sale that I could only secure a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
second-hand Tauchnitz edition for love or money;
and yet no one could lash Russian vices and foibles
with a truer or more unsparing hand than the
author of that extremely clever book. There is a
contradiction of one kind or another in every
phase of Russian life. The shopkeeper, who
speaks half-a-dozen languages well, cannot tell
what change to give you without the help of his
abacus. Bred in a wild, rough country, with splendid
opportunities for field-sports, and really with
plenty of pluck and muscle to excel in them, the
Russian gentleman cares little or nothing for them.
In the south, which alone I know, few except the
military men ride much, and when they do it is
not for pleasure; still fewer skate well, and the
best of those who skate at all are half Germans
from Riga; there are no games to correspond to
our cricket, football, or tennis. Of indoor amusements
dancing and cards are the Alpha and
Omega. Billiards, as played in Russia, resemble
skittles as much as billiards. In spite of the
gorgeous apparel of their priests, and the splendour
of their ceremonials, few educated Russians believe
in anything; though the peasant is as truly religious
as any peasant in the world. The literature
most read in Russia by ladies and idle men is
that of P. de Kock, and French novelists like him.</p>

<p>The members of the upper middle class, if that
means men of a certain position and wealth, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
scarcely live without perfume and cosmetics; yet in
travelling, if not at home, they wash their faces much
as an elephant washes his, by drawing water into their
mouth and then squirting it out into their hands,
whence they transfer it to their faces. Many of them
despise pocket-handkerchiefs, except as a means
of conveying perfume about with them. All of
them will meet a male acquaintance with the bow
of a courtier of Louis XV., and spit on the carpet
of a lady’s boudoir.</p>

<p>But meanwhile I have arrived at the office for
the sale of ‘podorojnas’, or travelling tickets; and as
I am in need of one for the journey to Lenkoran,
to be commenced on the morrow, I enter. At the
desk are two clerks in uniform, with a counting-board
before them. I state what I want; and
after ten minutes spent in referring to a book of
fares, and wrangling and reckoning over the abacus,
they tell me the charge is nine roubles, but suggest
that perhaps I would like a return pass. ‘Well, if I
did, what would that come to?’ More reasoning, and
a hotter dispute than ever. At last the answer is
arrived at, nineteen roubles ten copecks. Now,
according to all preconceived ideas, it seems absurd
that a return fare should cost more than twice the
single fare, so I declined, and asked for a single.
Here a consultation ensues, which results in my
being told with many smiling apologies that they
had made a slight mistake: the single pass would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
cost ten roubles. ‘All right,’ is my answer, ‘only
give it me.’ Here some one else’s business intervenes,
and the second clerk turns to have a chat and a
cigarette with a friend who has wandered in,
probably from some other office, in an absent way.
Whilst these two shock-headed counter-jumpers
are exchanging elaborate bows and grandiloquent
speeches, I have to wait in sad disgust. At last,
when the farewell bow has been performed, and the
gentleman with the dirty white shirt-front and
prison crop has had the honour of saluting his
friend and wishing him good-day, clerk number
one induces clerk number two to return to my
‘podorojna.’ Then they make a fourth calculation,
going over all the old ground again, and discover
with a fine smile and bow that they have made
another slight mistake&mdash;the real sum should have
been ten roubles fourteen copecks. To prevent
further calculations I hand in a hundred-rouble
note, and here follows another problem. How much
change ought they to give me? Anxious to get
away I solve the problem for them, and am met
merely by an incredulous stare, while the beads on
the abacus are rattled up and down harder than
ever. At length they make it out eighty-nine
roubles eighty-six copecks, and with a sigh of
relief hand me ninety roubles, adding, as they turn
to the small cash drawer, ‘Now we owe you eighty-six
copecks.’ I am weak enough to set them right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
and hand them one of the five-rouble notes back.
In return for this they hand me a three-rouble note
and two singles, leaving the error as bad as ever.
Again I feel impelled by conscience to interfere in
their interests; and apparently much against the
grain get them at last to pay me only what they
owe, or rather two copecks less, for try as I would
nothing could induce them to be absolutely
accurate.</p>

<p>Glad to get my pass at last, I leave the office,
meekly wondering what a pass to Lenkoran really
costs, and whether it would not be cheaper in the
end for Russia to have better-educated employés in
Government offices, even if she had to pay them a
trifle more. I took the trouble to jot down this
incident exactly as it happened at the time, because
I thought I might be accused of overcolouring
my picture of Russian official imbecility.</p>

<p>Hugging my pass to me as the emblem of freedom
from an enforced stay in a city I was already
beginning to detest, I drove round to my different
friends to say adieu, and to make my last preparations
for a start, noticing as I drove the extraordinarily
high-sounding names with which the Russians
of Tiflis dignify their drinking dens. Two
of the lowest order, standing side by side, were
‘The Rose of Paradise’ and ‘The New World.’
In bidding adieu to one of my friends the conversation
turned on Professor Bryce’s book, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
having met the author when in Tiflis. He assured
me that, in spite of all he could say, no one would
credit that the Professor had really achieved the
ascent of Ararat, so deep-rooted is the belief in
the Caucasus that Ararat cannot be climbed, and
so utterly unable are these people to judge of the
value of an Englishman’s word. I was struck
by the remark, because Professor Bryce says in his
book that none of the natives believe that Parrot
or Abich ever ascended Ararat, and it seemed singular
that he, too, should share their fate.</p>

<p>During the last day or two I had secured the
services of a Pole, an ex-keeper of the Grand Duke’s,
who was also a kind of assistant bird-stuffer at the
Tiflis Museum. Late on the evening of my last
day he turned up, with a little bundle of necessaries
in a pocket-handkerchief, and, having handed over
to him a five-barrelled revolving rifle on the principle
of Colt’s revolvers, which I had bought for
a mere song, he and I lay down to rest on beds
for the last time for many weeks. That rifle, by
the way, turned out an excellently accurate fire-arm,
the only weapon made on the revolving principle
that I ever met with of which so much
could be said.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, December 14, before the
first team of sleepy buffaloes had dragged their
load of country produce through the streets to the
bazaar, before the canine concert which makes the
night of Tiflis hideous had calmed down, Ivan
had returned from a last farewell to his young wife,
and I had put the last thing ready for a start.
Early as it was, my friend Lyall and his son were
up and ready to speed the parting guest they had
welcomed so kindly, and before six o’clock the
clattering of their horses and the rattle of my
wheels were waking the echoes of the German
colony. Dawn was breaking slowly as we dashed
over the bridge that spans the Kûr where it passes
through the Tartar bazaar. The hills were
standing out black and clearly defined against low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
fleecy clouds, the golden colour of an English lassie’s
hair, while here and there a higher peak caught the
bright red glow of the morning.</p>

<p>Our yemstchik had been taking part in a sister’s
wedding the day before, and, as he himself said,
was devoting himself to getting rid of the headache
consequent on the marriage festivities. His remedy
was the old-fashioned ‘hair of the dog that bit
him.’ But, luckily for travellers in Russia, a
yemstchik never drives so well as when drunk,
so our ‘troika’ whirled and bumped through the
streets, now rapidly filling with their early-rising
denizens, in grand style. In and out amongst
countless high-wheeled arbas, swearing, shouting,
screaming, just grazing one vehicle, slashing the
sleepy or sluggish owner of another with Parthian
whip, chaffing, chaffed, or cheered, we bowled along
at a gallop. How we did not run over foot-passengers
or smash some other conveyance I can’t
understand, for these yemstchiks turn the sharpest
corners at full speed, and apparently reck nothing
of life or limb.</p>

<p>Just as we were clearing the bazaar, our kind
escort trying, though mounted, in vain to keep pace
with us, we met a caravan of the long-eared beast
the Brighton cockney loves. Our yemstchik gave
a yell, the donkeys stolidly refused to budge, and
then followed one of the most brilliant charges on
record. The enemy, hampered by the huge packs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
which they bore, reeled and gave way before our
chariot’s furious course, and though a torrent of
abuse, no doubt, followed us, the owners of the
charged ones were too taken aback by the sudden
onset even to make their reproaches reach our
rapidly retreating ears.</p>

<p>Before leaving the town we met a party of musicians
coming from the night’s debauch which here
follows every wedding. These greeted us with
musical honours, and altogether our departure from
Tiflis was considered full of happy omens. As for
me, happy or unhappy omens were much a matter
of indifference, for, longing as I did for the chase
from which I had been so long debarred by trivial
difficulties at Tiflis, I was only full of delight at
my tardy freedom.</p>

<p>At the first station on the road we changed
horses and drank the stirrup-cup, said good-by
to our friends, and settled down to the serious
business of travel. To those who have never
travelled in Russia by the ordinary travelling-cart
it is impossible to give an adequate idea of
the miseries the shallow springless carts occasion
to their occupants as they jolt over the uneven
track that is here dignified by the title of post-road.
The traveller’s luggage probably fills the
cart, and on this, with knees drawn up, he has
to balance himself as well as he can, and continually
exercise all the prehensile powers he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
possesses to retain his precarious position. Many
natives never get used to this method of travelling,
and suffer a species of <i>mal de mer</i> from the
jolting, as well as other inconveniences. But for
myself, I had done a good deal of travelling in
post-carts, and except for the want of shelter in
bad weather minded it very little, being even
able to sleep as we drove, although how I ever
retained my seat whilst so doing I could never
understand.</p>

<p>At the first station from Tiflis we saw beside
the Kûr a large congregation of vultures gathered
round some carcase which the river had deposited
on its banks. Amongst them was one large black
vulture, a very rare bird, which I in vain
endeavoured to stalk and secure.</p>

<p>After leaving the station of the vultures we
drove day and night, sleeping in the cart whenever
nature asserted her need of rest, through a
plain bounded on the right by mountains, and on
the left by a scanty line of trees, which marks the
course of the Kûr. All along the route road
repairs were going on, bringing together gangs of
the most villanous-looking scoundrels the various
nationalities of the Caucasus can produce. I take
it, many of the highway murders and other outrages
one hears of may fairly be ascribed to
them. Strings of camels, with solemn tinkling
bells, which seemed to stretch from us to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
distant horizon, moved mechanically onwards as we
passed them, their plumed howdah sticks nodding
in time to that slow soft stride, which from its
even regularity always impressed me with an
idea of perpetual motion. Several times, too,
towards evening we came upon large camps near
a pool of water, where some hundreds of camels
were resting, their huge forms making, as they
knelt in line, a four-sided fort, within the walls
of which were stored the bales they had brought
out of the distant East. Amongst these large
camps I noticed a few of those white dromedaries
which travellers tell us are so much prized for
their speed in the East. Save for these camel
caravans, of which we met two or three a day,
all bound for Tiflis, a few minor trains of donkeys
laden with charcoal, or slow-going fourgons
filled with the carpets of Shusha and Shemakha,
our first two days’ journey was most uninteresting.
Dead bare steppe and barren bleak
hillside, with nothing more inspiriting than an
apparently deserted Tartar cemetery to break the
monotony, with its tall unhewn headstones of
white rock. Here and there, as the evening grew
into night, the road wound through low hills of
such a withered and blasted look that you felt
that the memorial stones, which you passed from
time to time in dark silent places, were sufficiently
suggestive of murder and evil deeds without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Ivan’s ghastly narratives. Up to the large station
of Akstapha, where several different routes branch
off from the main road between Tiflis and Shemakha,
we met or passed other travellers by
tarantasse occasionally.</p>

<p>Once we had left Akstapha, we appeared to
be the only travellers on the road. About three
stations from Elizabetpol we came across the
first specimen of Persian hawking which I had
yet seen. The bird used was a large falcon,
belled and jessed, as far as I could tell from a
distance, much as an English bird might be if
Englishmen still followed the pursuit of falconry.
Wherever I came across a Persian dwelling between
Tiflis and the Caspian, I invariably found
the hawk on his perch by the doorway, and his
two comrades in the chase&mdash;tall, broken-haired
greyhounds&mdash;basking somewhere near him. These
dogs work with the hawk, run down hares when
started, and put up partridges and ‘tooratsh’ (sand-grouse)
for the hawk to strike. To these dwellers
upon the steppe greyhounds and hawk supply
the place of a fowling-piece&mdash;an instrument of
destruction little used by Tartars and Persians.
Each man carries a rifle, an enormously long
weapon with a diminutive stock, not nearly as
big round as a man’s wrist, with a flint lock,
and a back and fore sight, with a small hole in
each through which the sportsman peers at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
game. Once you can get a view of the antelope
through these two sights simultaneously, you are
pretty sure to hit him; but the rifle requires a
great deal of manipulation (sticks arranged for a
rest, &amp;c.) before this desirable result can be
attained; and in the meanwhile it is hardly fair
to expect your quarry to remain motionless.
Moreover, a puff of wind or a drop of moisture
will ensure a missfire, and altogether the antelope
is very fairly safe.</p>

<p>After passing the Red Bridge&mdash;a place famous
for many a daring deed of highway robbery&mdash;we
passed a subterranean village, or what was practically
one, the roofs being almost on a level with
the ground. Below these roofs are in most instances
stables, in which dark and ill-ventilated
dens man and horse live together. The atmosphere
is worse than a London fog in the East
End, and the only reason that these dwellings do
not kill those who live in them is that Tartar and
steed pass at least eighteen hours of the twenty-four
in the pure air of the outside world. Herein
lies the secret of the healthy lives and iron muscles
of all Nature’s happily uncivilised children. Their
houses, it is true, are not such as would meet with
the full approval of a sanitary inspector of the
nineteenth century; but then, they look upon them
as the bear looks on his den&mdash;only as a place to
retire to for sleep, or to lie down in when sick or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
wounded. Windows are to them works of supererogation.
When they come back to their houses
it is only because it is too dark to work or play
outside; and never morning sun wastes his life
shedding glory on windows which, with frowsy
blinds, shut in sloth as they shut out daylight. It
often seemed to me that if these half-civilised people
only loved pure water as they love the fresh air,
they might live to any length of days. But, alas,
they don’t. A cold tub never occurs to them,
unless it comes accidentally in fording a mountain
stream, or, contrary to their expectations, as a
shower-bath from heaven.</p>

<p>At Kariur, the last station before Elizabetpol,
I stayed for a little rest and sport, to break the
monotony of our uneasy drive. Kariur is as bad
a station as any one could wish to see&mdash;horses and
men living, for the most part, together. But it
looked a likely place for game; and, indeed, its
looks did not belie it. Never in the best preserved
parks and woodlands of old England have I seen
more hares. They rose and scudded away in all
directions, at every stride. Sand-grouse were plentiful,
but extremely difficult to flush; although when
flushed I thought them very pretty shooting, and
when shot very fine for the table. The meat is
the whitest of any fowl I know. Bustards we saw,
and wild ducks; for the country seemed full of
tiny purling streams, which should make agriculture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
easy and profitable, though these natural
advantages are not utilised here. Antelopes were
tolerably numerous; and, two or three times, large
grey foxes went away in that insolently easy canter
peculiar to Reynard when the hounds are not behind
him. For nearly a quarter of an hour I tried in
vain to stalk a flock of very large reddish birds
with a decidedly game look and a shrill pipe, not
altogether unlike the curlew’s call. What they
were I could not find out, as they were extremely
shy, and I never saw any like them again. The
Tartars did not know them any more than did my
Tiflis gamekeeper, and I much regretted that I was
unable to procure a specimen. Kariur would be
a splendid place to pitch your tent near, if you
wanted to thoroughly sate your appetite for fowling,
and vary your experiences with the shot-gun by a
day or two spent in antelope-stalking with the rifle;
or, in wet weather, when the soil cakes on the
flying feet of the antelope, you might join the
Tartars in a capital gallop after the greyhounds,
with a certainty of a venison supper at the finish.</p>

<p>But much shooting, especially of the antelopes,
would, I saw at once, cause great jealousy and
unpleasantness amongst your few neighbours; so,
having had a capital day, crowned by a varied bag,
and, thanks to Ivan’s skill, a savoury supper, I
drove off in the dark to finish my last stage to
Gungha, as the natives call Elizabetpol. If any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Englishman should read what I have written, and,
tempted by hope of sport, follow in my track, let
him take one piece of advice from me. Never
believe any one between the Black Sea and the
Caspian; or, at least, never build any hopes on
alluring prospects suggested to your mind by the
statements of natives. To me Gungha was to be a
land of perfect peace, where in a really good hotel
I should lay down my weary limbs, and, after a
good supper, forget, in clean sheets, the injuries
inflicted on me by the merciless bumpings of my
travelling-cart. I admit that the vision of clean
sheets seemed far too good to be true, but when I
found that the occupant of the best inn’s best room
could not even get a samovar until the host’s
family had finished with it, and no better bed than
the floor and his bourka would constitute, I felt,
indeed, the vanity of all human hopes.</p>

<p>Gungha is a much better name for the town
than Elizabetpol. It has a thoroughly Asiatic
sound, as the town has a thoroughly Asiatic aspect:
flat-topped houses, thrown pell-mell together, without
design or reason in their arrangement; roads
that are destitute of trottoirs, full of pitfalls and
rocks by turns; at one time dark wildernesses of
blinding dust-storms, at another hopeless morasses,
in which you sink knee-deep in mud; open sewers
by every roadside, and a sufficient quantity of
trees scattered throughout to insure fever in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
due season; not one decent house in the town,
and nothing either of art or nature to attract the
traveller, or detain him when there. There is a
large bazaar, under a kind of arcade, composed of a
succession of dome-like roofs; here Persian work,
lambskins, and dried fruit form the staple commodities.
Under one dome the bootmakers were
busy; in the next your measure was taken, and
a sheepskin turban of any hue or shape made for
you whilst you waited. Outside, at the street
corner, an itinerant barber was shaving the head of
a true believer, whose tray of gaudy sweetstuff lay
on the ground beside him whilst he submitted to
the operation. In the square, near the hotel, a
Persian, with his beard and heavy moustache
ablaze with henna, was, with bell and voice, advertising
the merits of a falcon which he carried on
his wrist, whose broad bright eyes were hardly
less wild than his own. The man and bird would
have been a fine study for an artist’s pencil, so
wild and picturesque were they; and, as the bird
huddled itself into his open shirt front, against his
copper-coloured chest, or struck out with beak and
claw from its perch at the incautious hand of any
would-be purchaser, I felt sure that the Persian’s
pleasure in accepting a good round sum would not
be unalloyed by pain at parting from his brave
bird. But neither my man nor myself cared to
stay longer at Gungha than we were obliged; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
as soon as horses could be procured, we were
under way again.</p>

<p>The roads of the Caucasus are always execrable,
but there is still a degree of evil of which that
traveller knows nothing who has not travelled
from Gungha to the next station. The only thing
the road can be compared to is the dry bed of a
mountain cataract. Huge boulders strew the path
incessantly, and the arms of the miserable passenger
over it are continually almost wrenched from
their sockets by the leaps and bounds of the post-cart,
for it is almost needless to say that nothing
but a determined grasp of your seat will ensure
fixity of tenure for a moment. Across the road
at intervals we came upon the beds of those streams
whose winter fury had so bestrewn the road with
souvenirs of the mountain homes from which they
sprung; while right and left of us frequent cornfields
showed by their springing crop that the
mountain stream brought good as well as evil in
its train.</p>

<p>After the second station from our last starting-point,
the view became really beautiful. The
stony steppe grew narrower, and on either side
high mountain ranges showed themselves, snow-capped
and bright in the clear atmosphere of what
was quite an autumnal morning, though we were
now well into December. These distant peaks were
those of Shusha and Lesghia respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Every now and then the sand-grouse would
tempt me to call a halt; but though the place in
which they pitched was marked ever so carefully
and beaten as closely as men could beat it, we
found it quite impossible to flush the birds without
the assistance of a dog. As the light failed, we
saw phalanx after phalanx of starlings wheeling,
extending, and re-massing themselves in the dusky
skies; and as we drew near the reed-beds, towards
which their flight tended, we became witnesses
of a piece of very interesting bird-life. Near
the reed-beds were several trees, say half-a-dozen,
and as they were bare of leaves, we could see
on every tree some two or three hawks. As the
starlings swept down with rushing wings to their
nightly abiding-place, the hawks would glide from
their perches, and swooping amongst them, break
and turn the advancing host. Quick as the marauders
were, the starlings did not seem to fare
half so badly as might have been expected, and at
last all the wanderers were at rest in their reedy
home except one small band which, arriving later
than the rest, had been terribly harried by the
hawks, and seemed almost to have given up all
hope of getting safe home. On a tree some distance
from the reeds, halfway between the ground
and the highest branch, sat in silent state, or
gorged apathy, a splendid specimen of the king
of birds. Chivied perpetually by the hawks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
fairly scared out of their wits, the little band of
starlings swept round this desert throne, and
finally settled in a black throng all round the
mighty bird himself. To our astonishment he
took no notice, never moving a feather; and there
we left them, the hawks baffled and afraid to approach
the starlings’ sanctuary, and the weary
birds too tired to try again for their reed-bed, too
scared to mind the monarch in their midst.</p>

<p>At one station we met a party of peasants who
had been carrying soldiers’ kits from one village
to another, and on their return had been stopped,
beaten, and robbed of their wretched little earnings
by highwaymen. At another we met an Armenian
merchant with a ‘tchapar,’ or armed courier, who
was so abominably insolent to me that I was
obliged to give him an excessively rough shaking,
which cowed him considerably; and on the appearance
of my servant, who explained to the postmaster
who I was, the fellow became as servile as,
owing to my old coat, he had previously been insolent.
Here, too, we heard of highwaymen, the
post-station having been robbed of some horses,
which the postmaster had been lucky enough to
recover. The thieves had been caught, but I was
assured that would matter little to them, as a
trifling tip would set matters right with the local
authorities, and they would soon be in a fair way
to recoup themselves for their losses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>Later on, we met two of these gentry on the
road, armed to the teeth and well mounted; but
though they honoured us with a careful scrutiny,
our gleaming gun-barrels had a deterrent effect
upon them, and we drove on unmolested, though
our driver suffered a shock to his nervous system
which quite upset his merriment for the rest of the
drive. I am told that amongst these Tartar highwaymen
revolvers are quite common nowadays,
most of them possessing at least one of these
dangerous little tools.</p>

<p>The conversation turning on the lawlessness of
the Caucasus, elicited from my servant a strange <i>on
dit</i> of Tiflis. So utterly corrupt had every branch
of the civil service in the Caucasus become some
three months previous to my arrival therein, that
the Emperor sent down his secret agent, K&mdash;&mdash;,
with orders to inspect the state of affairs in disguise,
with plenary powers of dismissal and punishment
with regard to civil officials. He was to
clean the Augean stable of Tiflis. Supported by
a band of detectives brought with him from St.
Petersburg, he soon became the terror of the town.
Common rumour had it that three of the worst
in high places died of sheer fright shortly after his
advent. This may not have been the cause of their
deaths, probably was not, but that they were lucky
enough thus to escape punishment by natural deaths
is historical. One of K&mdash;&mdash;’s first acts was to try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
the police. Disguised as moujiks, he and his men
went bullying and swaggering through the streets,
apparently drunk as lords. The difficulty was to
get taken up, but after some time they managed to
accomplish even that, and were hauled away to the
police-station. Here K&mdash;&mdash; and his men tried to
get off by apologies and excuses, which were naturally
vain. Then, turning to his men, he said,
‘Hey brothers, suppose we give the good chief of
police a rouble apiece; he will see then that we
good Christians cannot be drunk.’ The roubles
were paid, the liberty of the pseudo-moujiks obtained,
and next day K&mdash;&mdash; came down and dismissed
the chief of police and his whole staff. So
through every branch of civic administration, meeting
with hindrances at every step, but still steadfastly
hunting down corruption wherever he suspected
it. Three generals holding civic posts he
forced into retirement; then, feeling that the opposition
of the military in a town still under military
law was too much for him, K&mdash;&mdash; retired.</p>

<p>But now a bitter white mist comes creeping
over the earth, wetting us to the skin in spite of our
heavy wraps, and stopping all conversation by the
chill discomfort it brings in its train; so for three
hours we lie down to rest at the next post-station,
rising again at seven to welcome as bright a morning
as any I had seen on my long drive. The
country was pretty, with here and there a group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of trees, and here and there a brook. The sun
was bright in the heavens, the hoar frost sparkled
on the ground, while every breath of the keen
morning breeze brought high spirits and a hunter’s
appetite along with it. The country now became
hilly, even close by the post-road, and every now
and then we saw a covey of red-legged partridges
scudding up the bare hillsides at a terrible pace.
These birds seemed to have taken the place of the
sand-grouse now. A drive of twenty versts from
Adji Kabool brought us to Goktchai, and here my
post-cart was destined to stay its joltings and bid
its jangling bells be still for some little time.</p>

<p>Goktchai is a large village, with one broad
main street, beginning at the Tiflis end in a bazaar,
passing halfway some barracks, where a few soldiers
are quartered, and ending in the ordinary Caucasian
village. On the way through the village
bazaar my eyes rested on a freshly slain tûr, or
mountain sheep, as well as other game; and the
sight of the noble head with its grand horns, combined
with a distant view of those peaks whence
it had so lately come, was too much for my powers
of resistance, and I determined then and there that
I too would at least try to kill a tûr in the wild
mountains of Daghestan.</p>

<p>At the post-station I heard the most glowing
accounts of the quantities of game to be met with
within two days’ ride of the village; but coupled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
with this came the news that these mountains
were so ill-famed on account of the brigands who
haunted them that scarcely any of the villagers
had ever been there, and none would go again for
any wage I liked to offer. This I received doubtfully,
and through my man made many offers, but
even ten roubles a day were refused by moujiks to
whom a hundred roubles would have been a fortune
with which to rest content for life. However,
though I began to believe in the reality of the
brigands, more especially as a post-cart had during
the last few days been carried off bodily in broad
daylight, I determined to wait a day and see
whether no one would come to accept my liberal
offer.</p>

<p>The day of waiting was spent in shooting
hares and red-legs on the nearest hills, whose steep
sides were simply alive with these swift-footed
birds, running like flies on the almost perpendicular
faces of the cliffs, or coming like bullets overhead
as my man drove them to me. The difficulty of
approaching the birds&mdash;as, though continually in
sight, they would never rise and never stop running&mdash;reminded
me of other days over the stiff furrows
of Northamptonshire; though, even with the help
of a sturdy Tartar, I found the bare rocks and
mud-faced crumbling hillsides worse going than
the wet ridge and furrow. The hills were covered
with dwarf larch and pomegranate-trees, the fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
of the latter having, alas, been all culled for this
year.</p>

<p>Tired and thirsty, towards three o’clock we saw
hanging over a steep cliff above us a large pomegranate-tree,
apparently unrobbed as yet. Its
bright fruit showed red and yellow through the
foliage; so with renewed energy my Tartar and
I struggled for a quarter of an hour to reach it.
At last we succeeded, and found, to our intense
disgust, that each fruit was hollow, a part of the
opposite side having been broken away and all the
interior taken out by the birds, who had left
nothing but the delusive husks which had so
cruelly disappointed us. I record this as one of
many similar sells inflicted on us whilst in
Daghestan.</p>

<p>When we started in pursuit of the red-legs we
had with us a dog, but so hard was the work that
in about three hours the poor beast refused to come
another yard, and lay down resolutely to rest.
His example was infectious, and though we kept
on for some time longer, we were soon so heartily
tired of the goat-like manner of progression necessary
in these hills, and the perpetual motion of the
partridges, that we gave up the chase and came
home. There we found good news awaiting us.
One of the Lesghian Tartars, who lived in the
second range of mountains from Goktchai, had
come in during the day to bring some game to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
bazaar, and, hearing of us, volunteered to guide us
to the home of the tûr and the chamois for a much
smaller sum than that which I had vainly offered
to the Russian moujiks. Allai, as he was called,
was a man about 6 feet 3 inches in height, hard
and wiry in build, who unfortunately spoke no
single word of any other language than his own
Lesghian Tartar. The ‘starost’ (elder) warned
me to beware of him, for, in spite of his gentle
ways and guileless manner, Allai was suspected of
knowing a great deal more of the brigands than
was exactly to his credit. Still, brigand or not,
it mattered very little to me, as Allai was evidently
the only man who could serve my purpose, and I
fancied I saw my way to securing myself and
servant from any outrage which our guide could
prevent. My plan was simply to arrange with him
that for his and his brother’s services, together with
the use of two horses for the first day, or for as far
as travelling on horseback should be practicable, I
was to pay him a certain sum, which sum, together
with all my other valuables, having been safely
deposited with a friend in the village, would only
become his on my safe return from my trip. This
agreement, together with the precaution of letting
the Russian military authorities quartered in the
village know whither I was bound, made me feel
tolerably safe, even should Allai be head and chief
of all the brigands from the Black Sea to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Caspian, and so, in spite of all the evil predictions
of the ‘starost’ and his friends, my man and I, with
Allai and his brother, set our faces to the blue
mountains and jogged right merrily on our way
next morning.</p>

<p>Our first resting-place was to be the Armenian
mountain village of Gerdaoul. The road was
beautiful in the extreme, though it required much
beauty to make amends for its roughness. The
greater part of the way our course lay over the
bare bed of a mountain torrent, whose tortuous
windings were everywhere full of great boulders,
over which no beast could move at more than a
foot’s pace. The hills, for the most part bare, were
boldly broken and ragged in outline; at the top
were frequent thickets of small firs and pomegranates,
while every here and there small clumps
of the same flecked the white hillsides. After
surmounting this first range of hills, in which
small game seemed to swarm, we came upon a
table-land which separated us from the snow-capped
range wherein our goal lay. On the very edge of
this table-land hangs the village of Gerdaoul. The
faces of the cottages composing it open out of the
hillside; the roofs, mere white cones, rise out of the
table-land above. Far more imposing to the eye
appear numbers of haystacks, shaped like sugar-loaves,
perched on high wooden scaffolds to save
them from marauding buffaloes, or to give shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
to the owner’s cattle in storms or at night. Here,
when Allai had made known who and what we
were, the village elder came out to welcome me and
bid me to his house, where, near a cheery hearth,
on which the huge logs glowed, cushions and
carpets and slippers invited to repose. Unluckily,
none of the good men of the village spoke a word
of anything but Tartar, of which Ivan knew but
little, and I only the words picked up during the
last two days. To the hungry man and the
sportsman a knowledge of the native language is
not, however, an absolute necessity, though it is an
immense advantage. Signs go a long way, and
amongst a race who care for sport as the Lesghian
Tartars do, sympathy for a brother sportsman does
the rest.</p>

<p>It was not long before tea was brought to me,
and as one after another the swarthy villagers
trooped in, I soon had quite a large assembly
round me. Each man as he came in gave me a
courteous greeting, and then, crossing his legs or
drawing them up under him, so as to squat on his
heels, he took up a meditative position on the floor.
Amongst themselves they were very taciturn, and
never spoke to me unless I made some remark to
them. When I did, instead of being amused at
my mutilation of their language, they looked grave
and did their best to puzzle out my meaning
amongst them. In the course of time a bowl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
scented water was brought me by my host, and,
having washed my hands in it, he and his friends
performed their own ablutions, though, their hands
being all stained brown with some dye in use
amongst them for the purpose, the washing had but
little apparent effect. I noticed that all the Tartars
and other inhabitants of Lesghia dyed their
hands in this manner.</p>

<p>After the bowl had gone its rounds, some game
I had shot, together with one of the chickens of
Gerdaoul and a huge tray of boiled rice, was
brought in. Everything was handed to me by
the host himself, and his courtesy went so far that
with his brown fingers he dexterously tore the
fowl to pieces, and selecting the best, offered
them to me. These people employed no table
utensils except the silver bowl to wash in and the
silver tray on which fowl, rice, and raisins, fried
in butter, were all served <i>en masse</i>. Every one
helped himself in turn from the dish with his
fingers, rolling the rice into a neat ball so as to
scarcely drop a grain. Gladly would I have done
the same, but for the first day or two I fancy
more rice went down my neck than down my
throat. The meal was followed by some capital
native wine, at which my Lesghian guide looked
askance, although I found afterwards that his
scruples were not troublesome except in public,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
and his taste for strong drink only strengthened
by occasional enforced abstinence.</p>

<p>After another ablution the meats were cleared
away and pipes produced, when, to my horror, I
found I had lost my tobacco pouch. However,
lots of tobacco was soon forthcoming, and
next morning a prettily knit purse for the fragrant
weed, worked in purple and gold by the
nimble fingers of one of the invisible daughters
of the house, was presented to me. Anything
more luxurious than a lounge on the cushion-covered
carpets of Gerdaoul, with a ruddy hearth
fire by your side, the good native wine to drink,
and the best of tobacco to smoke, with a crowd
of picturesquely wild fellows around you, and a
distant view of the mountains through the open
doorway, it has seldom been my lot to enjoy,
and it was far into the night before I could
make up my mind to leave it all for the realms of
sleep.</p>

<p>The entire population of Gerdaoul is Armenian,
and the village, like most Armenian villages, is a
thriving one. The Armenians are almost as good
colonists as the Germans; thrifty, sober, hard-working,
and astute, they are invariably better off
than their neighbours, who as invariably call them
thieves, and detest them heartily. In the case of
the Armenians of Gerdaoul I hoped they wronged
them, for I was certainly very hospitably received
and honestly treated there. The women of the
village kept out of our way for the most part,
though we constantly caught glimpses of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
figures flitting about, busy with some household
work, bringing home the cattle, or carpet-making.</p>

<p>Before almost every house stood a large frame,
constructed after the manner of the wool-work
frames of English ladies, only that it was as large
almost as the entire face of the hut. On these,
without any copy to work from, the Armenian
villagers worked those carpets, which are sold in
Tiflis as Persian of a second quality, or as
avowedly Armenian, from Shusha or Shemakha.</p>

<p>There is not unfrequently another and a smaller
frame covered with canvas, on which are daubs of
a brilliant colour, standing in the doorway beside
the carpet frame. This is for quite another purpose,
and is the property of the young men of the
establishment. Armed with this gaudy shield and
his old gun the Armenian fowler will procure as
many red-legs as he needs for the pot. The <i>modus
operandi</i> is as follows. A covey of birds having
been found, the man approaches with his shield in
front of him, so that from the first the birds never
see their enemy. When the attention of the covey
has been secured, the gunner stops, and planting
his shield before him, watches the birds through a
loophole in its centre. At first they probably
retire before the strange thing that comes towards
them, but as soon as it stops they stop too. Then
perhaps the shield is gradually drawn back; as
gradually, with heads craning forward, the birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
follow. For some time there is a struggle between
curiosity and fear; eventually curiosity gains the
day, and the whole covey comes up to within some
twenty yards of the snare, eagerly talking the
matter over amongst themselves as they come. Suddenly
the gunner gives a shrill whistle: instantly
all the birds run together; and in that moment the
charge of shot cuts through them, and leaves two-thirds
of their number dead on the ground. Yet
so foolish are they that, some of the Armenians
told me, unless the gunner showed himself, the
covey would keep reassembling round the snare
until the last bird was killed. Thus covey after
covey has been destroyed; and although the red-legged
partridge is as numerous in these hills as
mosquitoes in summer, still the Government has
thought fit to pronounce the use of these deadly
engines illegal, and to impose a heavy fine for the
use of them. Of course in these hills the law is
a dead letter, and the Armenians will very soon
exterminate the bird that now swarms around
them.</p>

<p>As I strolled through the village before continuing
my journey, I noticed several large mounds
rising abruptly in the streets, like large ant-hills.
These I found on inquiry were the doors to the
Armenian villagers’ cellars, and beneath each of
them lay buried many a huge red jar of good
native wine. Easy as it would be to open these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
unguarded vaults and abstract the contents, the
wine is perfectly safe, as the community is too
small for theft to escape unnoticed. At the birth
of every man child the wealthy Armenian buys
and buries a large jar of wine, and this is not
unearthed until the son’s coming of age or marriage
needs celebration. I should be glad to be
present at one of these feasts, as the wine of the
country only requires to be kept long enough to
render it excellent.</p>

<p>Our own cellar on the march was all comprised
in a goat’s-skin, about the size when full of an
ordinary pillow, with a wooden nipple at one
corner. This for safety’s sake I always carried on
my own shoulders, and used for a pillow at night.</p>

<p>Having refilled this portable cellar and thanked
our hosts, we resumed our ride across the table-land
to the hills beyond. The day was December
18, the air brisk and fresh, with scarcely any frost
in it&mdash;so mild indeed that during the ride I noticed
several clouded yellow and small copper butterflies.
The only life on this table-land seemed to be that of
hawks and hooded crows, which were in great force.
Duels between kestrels and crows recurred continually,
and to my surprise the crow generally had
the best of it. Once I came upon a grand specimen
of the falcon, and rode as near as I could to the
place where he was sitting, to get a shot at him,
hoping to add him to my collection of birds. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
my surprise he let me come within a dozen yards
of him, and then wheeling slowly up, pitched some
two hundred yards further off. I followed him:
again he waited, letting me come much closer before
he got up, and flying only a few yards before coming
down again. This time when I approached him he
had evidently turned sulky, and absolutely refused
to budge until I struck at him with my whip, when
he slowly moved away with a dead quail still
in his talons. I could not help admiring his sullen
pluck, so I left him to finish his dinner in peace.</p>

<p>Once out of the plain, the whole scene changed.
This second range was one of genuine mountains
well wooded, full of loud-voiced rushing torrents,
tall columns of white mist, and hoary trees, from
which the beard moss hung in grey festoons. In
front of us the lords of Daghestan raised their
glistening white crowns, so close as almost to seem
to overshadow us. After riding some miles along
the side of one of these watercourses, we came in
the afternoon to a Tartar village, famous for its
silk. Here on all sides were fine orchards, magnificent
walnut trees, and endless rows of mulberries,
on the leaves of which the silk-worms are fed. The
houses were of a different character to those by the
post-road and in the plain. No more mud huts,
but rather châlets, the lower half of composition
(mud and stone) and the top story of beam and
wattle, covered by a wooden or thatched roof. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
we rode through the main street, women drew up
their white wrappings round their eyes, and scuttled
away like rabbits as you pass through their
warren. On the outskirts of the village was a large
graveyard full of tall trees and grey old stones, on
which the shadows fell; while through the half
light a woman, in the white robe peculiar to her
people, recalled a hundred and one ghost stories,
which had frightened me into good behaviour as a
child.</p>

<p>Just outside the village I shot a fine grey
squirrel, the first squirrel I have seen in the
Caucasus, where their skins are much prized, the
furriers of Tiflis demanding as much as one rouble
seventy-five copecks for such a skin as the one I
secured. As the light failed, and we were beginning
to feel the corners and inequalities in our saddles in
a way that told us plainly how tired we were getting,
another village came in sight; and here we
decided to rest, though Allai did not by any means
approve of the suggestion. On asking for food we
were politely cursed to our faces; and when at last,
in the middle of the bazaar, we found a ‘duchan’
(inn), it was of so uninviting an aspect that a good
appetite was necessary to tempt a traveller inside
it. Under a wide awning was a room open on
three sides to within some four feet of the ground,
and inside this enclosure was a kind of dresser
sloping gradually from the back wall of the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
to the window ledge. On this the customers sat,
whilst below them and beside them the cooking of
‘sushliks’ went on. As soon as we were inside and
seated, a host of the worst-looking scoundrels I ever
saw swarmed round the place, to stare at and make
remarks upon us. Never were the lions in the Zoo
more eagerly and impertinently watched at feeding
time than were we, and certainly never by such an
ill-looking set as the owners of the shifting eyes
and high cheek-bones who surged round us. The
faces were worthy of a Chinese illustration of hell,
and I know of nothing else to which to compare
them. In their anxiety to get a good look at us,
they even broke down the wooden walls of the house.
All the time their tongues were busy, and from the
way in which they constantly spat and gesticulated,
their remarks could hardly have been favourable to
us. Unwisely I helped myself from my goatskin,
which gave great offence to the crowd, and evil
and angry were the looks cast upon us; so that I felt
that if they could but know that it was pork that
filled out the sides of my saddle-bags, my fate
would have been an unpleasant one. My man at
this juncture lost his temper, and became abusive to
a hook-nosed individual who had for some time
past been peering down his throat. All I could do
was of no avail; Ivan would not be pacified, and
so angry did the ever-increasing crowd become that
I was not at all surprised when a messenger arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
from the village governor or elder, warning us that
we must on no account dream of passing the night
in the village, for that although he had every desire
to protect us, the people were beyond his control,
and we should inevitably get our throats cut. So,
though the clouds were gathering black, and the
evening drawing in apace, we left the ‘duchan,’ and
went forward farther and farther into the shadows
of the mountains, leaving behind an angry murmuring
crowd that for one rash act would have
worried us as terriers worry rats.</p>

<p>And now, as we trudged wearily up the pass,
Allai rode up to me, and, with many ejaculations,
besought me not only to ride with my gun at the
ready, but the moment I caught a glimpse of a
man behind either bush or boulder to fire at him
first, and ask questions after. His fear was that
some of the rascals of the village we had just left
would get on ahead, form an ambuscade, and fire
upon us as we approached. He himself was evidently
determined to use his gun whenever he got
a chance; and, in spite of all I could say, made us
all uncomfortable by his nervousness throughout
the journey; the more so, as we had opportunities
of seeing that in most things Allai was as hardy
as other men. All things have an end&mdash;even the
windings of a mountain torrent; and at last, when
our limbs were aching with fatigue, a tiny hamlet in
the deepest recess of that shadowy ravine cheered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
us with the hope of rest and refreshment. Two
more minutes spent in warding off the attacks of
a clamorous host of dogs; then a door opens, a
flaming brand is held up, a swarthy face peers into
the equally dusky countenance of our guide, and
amid many greetings, we are ushered into the one-roomed
cottage of a Lesghian Tartar shepherd.</p>

<p>Cushions and carpets were soon arranged by the
hearth, slippers being brought for me; and then the
hospitable good fellows set to work to serve us
with their best. In the room were but few signs
of civilisation&mdash;nothing, in fact, that would have
been strange in the tents of the Ishmaelites of old.
The men were rough and tanned to a copper-colour
by the winds and weather of their wild
mountain home. Their clothes were rough and
ragged, and they were all armed to the teeth,
never laying their kinjals aside from sunrise to
sunrise; but their eyes were broad honest eyes,
that looked the stranger steadily in the face; their
manner to me was deferential as to an honoured
guest, but perfectly self-possessed and confident.</p>

<p>The women of the house had retired on our
entry, and for the whole of our sojourn with these
people, they remained in a kind of outbuilding
attached to the cottage, vouchsafing us only a
rare glimpse of two very pretty faces, which were
lost to sight in the folds of their envious mufflers
almost before they were seen. After the chicken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and rice had been cleared away, two little Lesghian
boys came in to have a look at their father’s
guests; and never in my life have I seen such
sturdy, handsome youngsters as these two sun-browned
little shepherds of seven and eight respectively.
Early in the morning, before the sun
had risen, these two young mountaineers were
astir, waked by the bell of Shaitan, the long-bearded
chief of their herd of goats. With crooks
in hand, in rough togas of sheepskin, I watched
the fine little fellows leading their hundred or more
goats up steep mountain tracks, to pastures that
hung far above the hamlet in the glen; and often
during the day we caught glimpses of them and
their charge on some precipitous pasture, or heard
the distant notes of the rough flutes with which
they amused themselves.</p>

<p>With such early training as this&mdash;taught at
seven to rely on their own resources, and take
charge of such wilful beasts as goats on a mountain
pasture&mdash;it is small wonder that Lesghians have
numbered amongst them such leaders as Schamyl
and Mansur Bey. Nor is it wonderful that, passing
year after year of their lives in the solitary grandeur
of their own mountains, they become the priest-led,
superstitious people they are. Schamyl the leader
would have had but little influence had he not also
been Schamyl the prophet, the divinely protected.
I have frequently heard Russians say that the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
reason that the Circassian war lasted as long as it
did was, that it was the policy of Russia to keep
the Caucasus as a training school for her young
officers and raw recruits; but, though this has
been often repeated by men who were in a position
to know something of the matter, I would rather
believe that the fiery zeal, tough sinews, and
impracticable mountain homes of the Lesghians
were the cause, than the calculating cruelty of
their enemies. Be that as it may, the Lesghians
of to-day&mdash;such at least as remain of them&mdash;are
an honest race of sturdy mountaineers, who have
little love for Russia, and concern themselves in no
way with the outside world. Those with whom I
stayed never travelled, even as far as Goktchai,
more than twice a year, and, I daresay, don’t
know yet that the Czar Alexander II. is dead. But
the evil spirit that wrought his shameful murder
was never cherished in a Lesghian or Tscherkess
bosom, any more than in the breasts of his own
Russian moujiks. I have known the common
people of Russia for three or four years, and
known some of them well: for it was ever my wont
to put up in peasants’ huts, and share the moujik’s
black bread when out shooting near his village,
and I have never heard anything but love and
respect for the Emperor from a poor man yet.
The moujik and the Tscherkess of to-day are not
as tongue-tied as some would have us believe; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
very few indeed are the great men of Russia whom
they do not detest and abuse; but the Emperor is
still to them a loving father, in whose tender
mercy&mdash;if they could only get at it through the
crowd of officials who fence him round, and hamper
the effects of his just will&mdash;the moujik entirely
confides.</p>

<p>If those Russians with whom I have talked
on Nihilism knew anything of the subject, the
Emperor’s great mistake was not the freeing of the
serfs&mdash;though by that he aroused the hostility of the
wealthy boyar class&mdash;but the reduction of the fees
of the universities to such a degree as to render a
first-rate education possible to thousands who, in
after life, would have to fill positions for which
they were too highly educated, and in which their
excessive education would only create discontent.
Is it not just possible that the excessive education
which we force upon the working classes of England
at the present time may have a somewhat similar
effect? I plead guilty to knowing very little of
politics; but when I hear on all sides the complaint
that domestic servants are becoming an
extinct race, having grown too fine for the state
of life to which (to quote the fine old catechism
phrase) it has pleased God to call them; when I
hear of the difficulty of obtaining agricultural
labourers, or old-fashioned country servants; when
every woman can play the piano, and none can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
cook a potato, I begin to wonder if education may
not be carried too far, and whether certain classes
would not be happier without it, and their work
better done. There is an old adage that ‘a little
knowledge is a dangerous thing;’ and even in
England we cannot pretend to do more than give
the working classes that ‘little knowledge’ which
produces the ill effects that a perfect education
might or might not cure.</p>

<p>But these are subjects beyond me, and I escape
gladly to the mountain side. When the first pale
ray of the dawn crept through the one tiny window
of our ‘serai,’ we left our couches, and went down
to lave our hands and faces in the icy waters of
the mountain torrent below. During the night
a slight fall of snow had made the valley white,
and a sharp frost had grizzled the long beard moss
on the mountain trees. We did not stay for breakfast,
but just collected all our impedimenta, determining
to do two hours’ climbing before sitting
down to eat and drink, and fasten on those
abominable iron claws, without which the rest of
the climb would be impracticable.</p>

<p>For one like myself, but little used to mountaineering,
the first two hours’ climb was very
weary work; and when at last we stopped to rest
and breakfast, the high peaks seemed further off
than ever. Growing close to the boulder round
which we breakfasted was a medlar-tree, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
half frozen fruit was deliciously refreshing after
our toil. But Allai gave us little time to rest,
so that having hurried through our meal, and spent
a few minutes in watching the sun battling his way
through the mountain mists, we fastened on the
climbing-irons and pursued our way up steep
slopes covered with forests of beeches, whose dry
fallen leaves scattered from under our feet and
revealed the treacherous black ice beneath.</p>

<p>Here we came on bear tracks, and heard the cry
of the red deer in some beech woods on a neighbouring
mountain side. As we peered over an abyss
we caught sight of three ‘marral,’ as the natives call
them, far out of shot on the other side. To get to
them would have been a day’s work; so we could
only look and long; while the wild cry of another
stag, which we could not see, reverberated through
the woods, and made our hearts jump at the
sound. Far down in the abyss the wooded tops
of smaller mountains rose like islands from a tumbling
sea of clouds like those we call woolsacks at
home; a sea that, as evening approaches, rises higher
and higher, until the whole mountain top is submerged
in its cold waves. But here above the
clouds, out of sight of the earth which they hid,
all was bright as an Italian summer, in spite of the
snow and ice, until four o’clock in the afternoon.
Here, beautifying the snowy forests by their presence,
I found two varieties of primula: one, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
commonest, a deep lilac; the other, a pure white;
we also found some sweet violets, which, together
with the primulas, made a handsome bouquet
for Christmas time. The trees in the woods we
passed through were almost entirely beech, everywhere
covered with the beard moss, which gave
them a quaint old-world look; amongst them were
a few medlars and pears; while underfoot the
blackberry briars made our upward progress difficult.
Bracken and ‘trichomanes’ were the only
representatives of the fern family which I noticed
during the day.</p>

<p>On this our first essay on the mountain-side
we only just reached the upper edge of the wooded
belt, and it was here, when we had scarcely left the
trees behind us, that I got my only shot during
the day. Passing through a small recess in the
mountain-side, where all was still dark and chill, the
sun not having penetrated there since night left it,
I heard a bound and a rustle, and a chamois gave
me a fair running shot, of which I did not make
the most, only wounding, and eventually losing
him, after a day wasted in pursuit. So we
turned back sore-footed and empty-handed, trudging
down the mountain to the rising mist waves
that crept up to meet us, and, plunging into them,
felt for a time like men lost in the night, where
neither the peaks of the mountains above, nor the
fires of the valley beneath, were visible to us;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
where trees took weird shapes, like those in Doré’s
pictures; where all was dank, and dark, and chill,
so that a half wonder grew upon us as to whether
anywhere down beneath a bright fire, cushions, and
comfort could be waiting for us.</p>

<p>At last the house fires glimmered from below
like stars through a night of fog, and hurrying on,
slipping and stumbling over the wet grass, sliding
off our greasy leather stockings to bump along for
twenty yards or so on our aching shoulders, we
reached our Lesghian house, and had soon forgotten
(except when the hateful clamps caught our eye)
all the petty tribulations which had interfered
with our appreciation of the magnificent mountain
scenery.</p>

<p>These Lesghians lead a happy life, though (or
perhaps, because) a simple one. A flock of goats
find shepherd’s work for the hardy handsome
boys to do. A field of corn just above the house
on a little table-land keeps the family in bread. A
tree which grows in the crannies of the rock, in
appearance like a small sloe-bush, supplies a decoction
made from its root, and leaves so like tea as to
have deceived me into believing that it was what
it seemed. The industry of the women strews the
floor with a superfluity of carpets, cushions, and
mats; makes slippers for the men, cloth for such
clothes as are not made of sheepskin, and a delicious
drink from the medlars that grow on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
mountain. The mountain sends them down the
purest of water, finds them in unlimited fuel, and
provides them with a dessert as varied as that of
the richest Russian in the land: medlars, beechnuts,
chestnuts, walnuts, pears, and berries of a
dozen different kinds. Their religion forbids them
to drink wine, so that, never having used it, they
do not feel the want of it. Apples may be bought
in the neighbouring village of the largest size and
most luscious quality for threepence per hundred.
Pheasants and red-legs abound, and are easily
caught or shot (though I never heard of snares
being used for them), while red deer and mountain
sheep are for the bolder and stronger among
the young men. Wild swine come all too close to
the cornfield in autumn, and in slaying of these
the Lesghian not only protects his harvest, but
obtains leather of the best quality for his mocassins.
Bear’s fat furnishes the lamps (made after the fashion
of the sepulchral lamps of Greece) with fuel; and
the rheumatic patient with an external application
that beats Elliman’s embrocation out of sight;
while those who suffer from colds take it internally,
as English people take gruel, and, I dare say, with
as good a result. From the beard moss the Lesghian
makes a dye with which to stain his hands,
and make them a manly brown, or ‘good fast
washing colour,’ as the haberdashers have it; while
if he be a dandy, he borrows from it a darker hue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
for his moustache, and for the solitary love-lock
which his religion and his barber permit him to
retain. Best of all virtues, the Lesghians are
cleanly. In the whole of my stay amongst them,
my night’s rest was never broken by the antics of
insect gymnasts or the attacks of burlier foes.</p>

<p>The Sunday we spent in the mountain hamlet,
each according to his own fancy. Allai went at
dawn into the higher peaks to look for traces of
game. Ivan spent his morning cross-legged on
the floor washing clothes; and at mid-day we all
three met on an eminence some two hours’ climb
from the valley, to photograph some of the scenery
with one of Rouch’s patent dry-plate apparatuses.
On our way we met the village hadji, who was
vastly interested, and promised to come in and
see more of us and our photographs in the evening.</p>

<p>In the valley the thermometer registered 70°,
while on the higher peaks, from which we tried to
take photographs, it registered 54° in the sun; meanwhile
the grass below was matted with ice which
showed no signs of thawing. We gathered quite
a fine bouquet on our way up&mdash;primulas, violets,
the white blossom of the wild strawberry, forget-me-nots,
crimson clover, and a single golden buttercup.
As for the photography, we chose some
excellent views, and took them very carefully,
going away quite satisfied that those at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
would be able to share our enthusiasm for the
scenery of Lesghia.</p>

<p>On our return we were met by an admiring
crowd, amongst whom for a few minutes one woman
remained, curiosity in her case overcoming the
modest scruples of her race. We made the best of
our opportunity, and photographed her promptly;
but alas! it was only the ‘baboushka.’</p>

<p>As the ‘baboushka’ is a variety of the female
race to the best of my knowledge unknown in
England, I may as well take this opportunity of
describing her. She is quite an institution in
Russia, no household being complete without her.
Generally she is the mother of the paterfamilias,
sometimes only his mother-in-law, at others merely
an aged female relative who wants a home and is
willing to undertake the housekeeping in return
for one. Whatever she is, wherever she comes
from, there she is, the motive managing power of
every moujik’s home: in manner quiet, giving
precedence to the wife, making no complaint when
the husband gets drunk, no stirrer-up of strife, no
busybody, but just a quiet old crone, with an eye on
the children, an immense capacity for drudgery,
and sufficient experience to help the wife in all her
little troubles. Her corner is on the top of the
‘petchka’ (oven), whither she retires early in the
evening, emerging thence to get the samovar
ready long before daylight. Her weaknesses are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
vodka and the papiros, and her greatest happiness
a village wedding, at which she generally assists
as one of a kind of chorus which I have described
before. It is needless to add, perhaps, that in
appearance she is sufficiently gruesome to hold the
youngest child in awe of her.</p>

<p>Having photographed the ‘baboushka,’ we went
in to our evening meal, during and after which
guests dropped in rapidly, until we had quite a
crowded reception. Photography was evidently
the attraction; and as soon as our pipes were lit
the aged hadji moved that the photographs be
exhibited. To comply with this request it became
necessary to ‘develop.’ Now to stand behind a
tripod with a black rag over your head, and direct
the machine as required, Ivan and myself had found
fairly easy; but when with chemicals and other
diablerie we had to make manifest the results of
our mumming on the hillside, we began to grow
nervous. Still we put as good a face upon it
as we could, and made at least a show of understanding
what we were about. The fire-place was
covered over with a bourka, the lamp extinguished,
and the wondering guests seated in a circle, with
strict injunctions not to shout above a whisper or
stir save at their peril. Then a candle was prevailed
upon to remain on an inverted dish within
the threefold walls of a yellow baize screen, whence
it shed a ghastly light upon all the inmates of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
hut. Seated cross-legged, with a solemn face like
an owl by daylight, sat the chief photographer, and
Ivan served him with a due gravity. Bowls of
water, and bottles of various baleful drugs, lent an
air of devilment to the whole scene, which, with the
wild faces round, was suggestive rather of witchcraft
than photography. The first plate produced
having been carefully washed, was subjected to the
developing fluid. Thrice and four times was the
dark liquid washed backwards and forwards over
the pure surface. Interest in our guests rose to
excitement; diffidence in ourselves to panic. To
and fro, to and fro went the black water, but no
sign of any sublime peak or picturesque village was
slowly shadowed forth upon the glass.</p>

<p>Horrid suspicions began to take possession of
us. Surely no mistake could have happened this
time. True, we remembered that on the only other
occasion on which we attempted photography we
certainly did make a group of Tartars miserably
quiet for a quarter of an hour, in all sorts of
picturesque (and uncomfortable) attitudes in the
main street of Kertch; that we also kept ourselves
and our friends’ servants at work for two weary
hours in preparations for developing, after which
we opened the slides and found that no plates had
ever been inserted. But this time there was no
mistake about the plates. One after another we
opened the slides and poured the developing fluid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
over their contents; but alas! none of that ‘flashing’
appearance of which Mr. Rouch so emphatically
speaks resulted therefrom. On the contrary, the
surface of the plates maintained an exasperating
sameness in appearance.</p>

<p>At last, however, when almost all the plates had
been laid by in disgust, something dark which
would not wash out, and so small that even Allai
could not quite manage to put his thumb exactly on
it at the first attempt, did appear. What applause
it met with; what speculations as to what it might
represent. We distinctly remembered to have photographed
certain majestic snow-peaks, to do which
we had almost broken our hearts with uphill toil;
we knew we had photographed a village from a bend
in a mountain torrent at the cost of wet feet; but
what was this? Could it be Allai’s hat? Might
it be a back view of the stooping Ivan? Could it
possibly be a fancy portrait of the photographer
himself as he appeared under his robe of mystery?</p>

<p>Whatever it was, we explained to the credulous
Lesghians that, after undergoing a magnifying process
at home, it would no doubt convey a correct
idea of the scenery of Daghestan to English minds.
With this explanation we were thankful to see
they were content, and silently resolved to give
away our photographic apparatus at the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>The next entry in the rough log I kept at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
time is made after my return from Daghestan. On
December 23, Ivan, Allai, two other Lesghians,
and myself started for the higher peaks, in which
the tûr, or mountain sheep, are said to dwell.
After a day of hard climbing we reached a ruined
bothy used by mountain shepherds in the height
of summer, which marks the highest point to which
any of the neighbouring flocks attain even then.
When we reached it, the roof had been partly
blown off, and the walls broken in; snow surrounded
us as far as the eye could see; snow had formed
a drift inside the hut on the side opposite the
breach in the wall; snow in a broken wooden
trencher was being melted with difficulty over a
wood fire in the middle of the hut by one of our
men for tea; while, without, the hard profiles of
the snow peaks surrounded us on all sides.</p>

<p>We had started that morning at five, and when
we reached the bothy the starlight was glimmering
on the snow. Once during the day I had had a
glimpse of a flock of wild goats, in colour black,
with fine horns and tremendous beards. They
were within 150 yards, and I might easily have
secured one, but unluckily was persuaded by my
man to let them come a little closer, so as to make
assurance doubly sure. For a moment they disappeared
round a large boulder, and I waited for the
leading goat to appear on my side of the mass,
determined to fire as soon as he did so. But my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
hopes were doomed to disappointment. The next
I saw of those goats they were going like mad
things down the mountain-side a quarter of a mile
off. Several times we saw tracks of bears, and
once I heard one scrambling away, within shot of
me probably, but I could not catch sight of him
in time amongst the fir-trees. Another time we
came upon a steep ascent, from the top of which a
shower of small stones apprised us of the flight of
three tûr; but though my men caught a glimpse of
them, they were too far off even had I seen them,
which I did not. My man Ivan had a long shot
at a chamois and missed him, so that, after a hard
day’s climbing, we reached the bothy empty-handed.</p>

<p>Once fairly amongst the snow and ice on the
bare rocks, cutting steps for our ascent, and climbing
rather with our hands than with our feet, I did
not so much mind it; though running across a
rattling moraine as it shifted from under us
was a new and startling experience to me. The
almost perpendicular grass slopes which we had to
cross before getting clear of the forest were the
greatest trials we had. Under the guidance of
Adolphe Folliguet, of Chamounix, I have since
tried mountaineering in Switzerland, after the tourists
have all returned, and a few chamois may be
seen not further from Chamounix than the Aiguille
Dru; but though he does not choose the easiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
tracks when in pursuit of his favourite game, or
stop too often to help his less goat-like followers,
I never crossed with him such difficult places as
these Lesghian grass-slopes. Too hard to give
you any hold for your alpenstock, the short fine
grass slips from under the iron claws of your
clamps; the butt of the rifle slung across your
shoulders comes in collision with the steep bank
and almost hurls you into space; the claws of the
clamp catch in your other boot as you cautiously
pass one foot over another, and at every step it
seems a toss-up whether you go or stay.</p>

<p>It required, then, no small inducement to tempt
me to continue my toil when the end of the day’s
journey had been reached. But the inducement
was there. As we stood for a moment at the
door of the hut to take in some of the grandeur
of the scenery which surrounded us, seven glorious
red deer came tossing their heads as they
followed one another round the boulder of a neighbouring
crag. Between us and them was a great
gulf fixed, which could only be crossed by a difficult
and tedious climb; but the stag’s magnificent
head was a prize worth trying for; so, tired though
I was, I took one of the Tartars with me, and as
soon as the herd had passed behind a ridge, started
on their track. Following close in their steps, we
had to cross a sheet of frozen snow hanging like a
pentice over the edge of a bottomless abyss. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
guide went first, scooping hollows with the butt of
his rifle in which to put his feet, and in his steps I
followed with comparative ease, though it required
a good head to look down from our perilous pathway.</p>

<p>Still the excitement of the chase kept me up;
and once across this long stretch of snow the
going was easy enough, until we came to a small
chasm which had to be crossed by jumping. Had
we not looked too long at it the jump would not
have appalled us, as it was easily within the powers
of the most third-rate athlete. As it was, it was
not without a good deal of screwing up that I got
myself to the sticking-point, and gave my guide
a lead across. After this I went on by myself,
my Lesghian going back, in despair of ever getting
nearer to the deer. For nearly an hour I continued
to follow up the track, expecting every time
I peered over a ridge to find the herd in range
just on the other side; and so alluring was the
chase that even now, looking back, I cannot help
feeling that if I had only gone on to that next
bluff I should have had my reward.</p>

<p>But the human frame won’t go on moving for
ever, however much the will may desire it to, and
my unlucky limbs kept reminding me by certain
aches and stumbles that they had almost reached
the limit of their powers of endurance. So all
unwilling I gave in and turned back. And now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
my difficulties began. The climb back, like all
such climbs, seemed twice as long as it had appeared
in coming. My eyes were getting heavy
and feet like lead. There was no game ahead to
allure me forward, no guide by my side to advise
or direct my steps. I began to regret my persistent
pursuit of the red deer. Still, in spite of
my fatigue, all went well until I began to cross
the roof-like sheet of snow between myself and the
hut. Here the light seemed worse than it had
been in coming, and the footholds hard to distinguish.
When halfway across I very nearly concluded
my travels, not only for that night but for
ever. One of my feet slipped out of the hole in
which I had placed it, and brought me on my face
on the snow. Instinctively I fell inwards, driving
my rifle-barrels with all my strength into the snow,
and there, for the worst minute of my life, I hung,
one foot still in one of the steps and the other leg
hanging loose on the smooth surface, not daring
to lift myself, for fear lest any extra pressure should
break my remaining foothold or loosen the grip
of my rifle in the snow, and so send me trebogging
down the slope, over the edge of which I should
infallibly shoot into eternity. However, it was
Christmas Eve, and some good angel buoyed me
up; and when in fear and trembling I slowly made
the effort, I did with difficulty regain the upright
position, and in a few more minutes got off that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
treacherous snow-slope, with a feeling of relief
that almost compensated for the trouble it had cost
me.</p>

<p>In the hut the scene was anything but suggestive
of Christmas cheer. Thawed snow and a
little stale bread was our only fare; our only music
a bitter wind, until now unnoticed, that whistled
through the gaps in our walls. Even the Lesghians
could not sleep, though they lay almost in
the embers of the fire, the pungent smoke from
which effectually blinded us for the time. All
night long we moved about like wild beasts in a
cage, in a vain endeavour to keep warm. Now
and then one of us would sip the few drops of
thawed snow from the half-burnt fragment of the
wooden bowl on the fire. Once or twice a few
minutes’ sleep came to us, but they were soon
ended with a start and a shiver that effectually
brought us back from dreamland.</p>

<p>I don’t think any one slept that night: the
stars were almost as bright as ever when we left
the hut to warm ourselves by exercise, and make
believe that a new day had begun. For some few
minutes before we left our bleak night’s lodging
shrill whistlings on all sides had made me believe
that other human beings besides ourselves were
astir. As our eyes got accustomed to the light
the true source of the noise was revealed. All
round us groups of that great grey bird the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Lesghians call the mountain turkey were busily
feeding, and vigorously whistling as they fed.
Tame as they were, I found that shooting them
in that dim light with an ‘express’ rifle was no easy
work, and the only one I killed fell in a crevasse,
in which we were obliged, hungry though we were,
to leave him. Had I tried when I first left the
hut I might have easily killed several, as they
would let me approach within a dozen yards of
them, so tame were they. But at that early hour
we had hopes that along some one of the well-beaten
tracks near the hut we might see tûr or
wild goat descending to the pastures below; and
with this possibility in view we let the turkeys
alone until the coming dawn had made them comparatively
wild.</p>

<p>Before dawn we saw some birds which the
mountaineers call black pheasants&mdash;birds with a
flight and shape in every way justifying their
name. These, as well as the turkeys, disappeared
as if by magic at dawn. The peaks, which had
been loud with their calls and alive with their
bustling forms half an hour ago, were now still as
if they had never known them, and but for their
tracks upon the snow, one might have fancied they
were mere nightmares which the daylight had
dispersed. The cause of their sudden disappearance
Allai pointed out to me in the forms of two
broad-winged lammergeiers that came with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
first glow of morning, sailing on steady pinions
round the mountain top.</p>

<p>Later on in the day, when, owing to lack of
supplies and disaffection amongst my men, I was
retracing my steps to the valley, I saw more of
these mountain kings. We had stretched ourselves
on a ledge of rock on which the sun shone
rather warmly, and, weary of climbing, were
resting in his cheering beams, when a shadow
came between us and him, and looking up, we
saw the form of one of these bearded robbers
hovering over us. A bullet from my ‘express’ cut
out a handful of his pinions; for a moment the
great bird staggered as if he was coming down,
but, to my chagrin, righted himself and sailed on,
steady and calm as ever, to finish his circuit round
a neighbouring mountain top, and, crowning insolence,
to repass us exactly as he had passed
before, except that this time the bullet did not
fly so near its mark.</p>

<p>My time was now getting short; so that
though I had to leave my mountain home empty-handed,
I decided to pocket my failure, and return
at once to the post-road, to continue my journey
to the Caspian. Had I had a good guide, who
was also a keen sportsman, a good stalking glass,
and had I come a month earlier, I am sure the
result of my visit from a sporting point of view
might have been widely different. It is easy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
see that game is extremely plentiful, and I still
look forward to a good time coming, when, knowing
my ground and my men better, I may profit
by my past experiences, and make a bag that any
sportsman might be proud of. It is, I believe,
always very long odds against a man making a
large bag in a country utterly strange to him
without efficient guides.</p>

<p>My farewell to my Lesghian hosts had in it
more of regret than characterised my leave-takings
generally in the Caucasus; and my presentiments
did not deceive me, for it was long before I met with
such a cleanly, hospitable home again. Christmas
Day I spent at Gerdaoul, where we had a deer
drive among the mountains on a pouring wet day,
which made our style of sport peculiarly unpleasant.
Unluckily, Ivan shot a doe early in
the day, and over the carcass of this the whole
band of Armenians&mdash;who were to us both beaters
and hosts&mdash;fought like dogs over a bone. Seeing
there was no chance of more sport that day, I left
them to stab one another for a half pound more or
less of venison if they liked; and feeling a twinge or
two of rheumatism, trudged on towards Goktchai,
leaving Allai to follow with the horses.</p>

<p>At one of the villages on my way back I was
met by a deputation, asking me to sanction the
release of a wretched Tartar, who had applied
some abusive language to me on my journey to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
the Lesghian hamlet, of which, in my ignorance
of the dialect, I had been utterly unconscious. It
seems Allai had found time to send over to the
elder of the village, representing me as a prince
under the protection of the Russian Government,
and on his representations the poor devil had been
confined in a miserable dark hut ever since. Of
course I gave the necessary sanction, though I felt
that it might be as well not to correct Allai’s mistaken
notion of my position until I was safe again
in Goktchai. I may here mention that, though we
luckily escaped without molestation, we were continually
advised to take an escort; and even Allai
secured one at his own expense to see his brother
and horses safe back to the post-road when he left
us with the Lesghians. The Lesghians themselves
never leave their houses without one well-armed
man to protect their goods from the pilfering
Tartars, who abound in these little-visited regions.
I am thus particular in mentioning these things, in
order that no one who may be led to follow in my
steps may come to grief through a want of proper
caution, induced by my good luck. On our way
back to Goktchai I saw one of the beautiful Dalmatian
creepers which sometimes occur here,
though Allai assured me they are by no means
common.</p>

</div>

<p>The day after our return to the post-road, we
found on waking that the change in the weather
predicted by our mountain guides had already set
in. There was no longer that crisp raciness in the
air which carried us through the day’s work with
comparative ease and pleasure, but a steady cold
rain, with occasional snowstorms, blinded the sun
and changed the roads into morasses. The hills
were already snow-clad in that one night, and had
we not left Gerdaoul when we did, we might have
remained for the winter. As it was, the prospect
of our journey to Lenkoran was not a bright one.
Every rill that crossed the road was fast swelling
to a torrent, and the fifty-seven versts which
formed our day’s allotted work, and terminated at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Aksu, were versts of misery and discomfort hard
to bear.</p>

<p>At Aksu the postmaster refused to give us
horses, alleging that, in the present state of the
weather, to attempt the range of hills between his
station and Shemakha would only result in the
destruction of the post-cart, loss of horses, and
broken limbs for the fares, especially now that the
mists and darkness of night were rendering what
road there was invisible.</p>

<p>On the road, before reaching Aksu, we came
across three of the brigands of whom we have
heard so much, in charge of a band of ‘tchapars’
(mounted policemen), who seemed a vast deal more
like the highwaymen of romance than their sorry-looking
captives did. On the morning of December
28 we left Aksu for Shemakha, a distance of
forty versts, over hills whose sides were like wet
ploughed fields. Here the post-cart was unable to
proceed as fast as we could walk, so that we
solaced ourselves by shooting <i>en route</i>, and derived
some consolation from the abundance of game which
we found on these hillsides. Red-legs, hares, and
pheasants swarmed; and what with these, the owls,
and other birds of prey with which the hills
teemed, we had a very lively time. Wolves, too,
have their haunts here, as witness a deserted post-cart,
on the horses attached to which a traveller
and his yemstchik had escaped during the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
week, leaving their cart with the baggage to
take care of itself.</p>

<p>I used to believe, before I saw Aksu, that nowhere
in the world did magpies more abound than
in Galway round Loughrea, or in some favoured
parts of France; but here in Aksu I counted seventeen
of these poaching rascals all together like a
flock of sparrows. In the hills halfway between
Aksu and Shemakha I saw quite a mob of eagles
and hawks, busy, I presume, with the half-frozen
smaller birds and hares. Two or three lammergeiers
tempted me to a prolonged chase; but
though I hit two of them, my number four shot
would not bring them down, and I confess to
being unable to touch them with my rifle, in spite
of their slow wheeling flight.</p>

<p>Shemakha is not a town to detain a weary
traveller long. The only inn I could find was an
underground ‘duchan,’ to which access was obtained
by a flight of stone steps leading from the road
above to a kind of vault, in which puddles stood
on the floor, drained off from the mud above; and
here the cooking and liquor were as infamous as
the accommodation. Shemakha is mainly composed
of flat-topped Asiatic houses and a few
smart new ones of the common Russian stamp,
with white plastered sides and green roofs that
looked bitterly cold and out of place in their
setting of snow and winter storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>The roads of this town are, without exception,
the worst for a town I ever saw; nothing but the
bed of a mountain torrent could be worse. The
town bore traces of damage done by that volcanic
action from which it is a too frequent sufferer.
The principal residents are, I believe, Armenian;
the principal industry the manufacture of carpets.
Shemakha is, I am told, an extremely old town,
and was, in days gone by, the capital of a ‘gubernia,’
though before the Russian rule, in the
early Persian days, the great town was Aksu, the
post-station at the foot of the hills, and not
Shemakha. Now Aksu has declined to a very
insignificant position; and even should the contemplated
railway from Tiflis to Baku ever become
a reality, the volcanic spasms from which it so
frequently suffers will probably prevent Shemakha
ever attaining to any real importance.</p>

<p>After leaving Shemakha the main post-road
runs on to Baku, the principal port on this side
the Caspian. As, however, my object was to get
into Persia, or, at least, so near to Persia as to run
a chance of finding tigers, I left the main road at
Shemakha, and bore away to the south-east for
Lenkoran. The road between Shemakha and
Lenkoran being extremely little used, I was
destined to see, before I reached the Caspian, the
lowest depths of the discomforts of Russian post-travelling.
Hitherto there had been at least three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
‘troikas’ (teams) kept at each station; now no
station had more than two. One of these teams
being always retained for emergencies (such as the
needs of a special courier), there remained one
team to do all the work. Luckily for me, I
appeared to be the only traveller; had it been
otherwise, I might still be stranded at some post-house
on the borders of the Mooghan steppe.</p>

<p>As Shemakha held out no great inducements
to me to remain, my man and I were not
long in resuming our journey. After a stage of
twenty versts through rough hilly country, we put
up for the night at a station which I have recorded
by name, that I may make it infamous as
the very worst post-station in the Russian empire,
and, therefore, probably in the world. It seems a
great deal for one to say who, after all, has seen
only one side of the mighty empire of Russia; but
it must be remembered that in speaking thus I am
simply relying on the Russians themselves, who
assure me that the Russian post-roads in the
Caucasus are the worst in the empire, and of
these I have had some experience. Though I
have carefully examined my map, I cannot find
the name of the station of which I am now writing
upon it; but then I have had considerable difficulty
in recognising many other well-known
places, owing to differences in the spelling of
the names, and even in the names themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
since it is no uncommon thing to meet with a
village boasting of nearly as many names as
inhabitants. Tchaillee is as near the phonetic
spelling of the name of this villanous collection
of hovels as I can make it.</p>

<p>When we arrived, night had set in, and with
it foul weather. We were tired, wet, and hungry.
No horses could have been had even if we would
have continued our journey that night; so we
decided to remain, and asked our way to the
traveller’s room. The station is placed on very
high ground, and in an exposed position. At
the most exposed corner is the room in which
we were to pass the night. The floor was literally
more wet and filthy than the road without; you
could not stand out of a puddle unless you stood
on the only piece of furniture in the room&mdash;a solitary
bench, extremely rickety with old age, and
not large enough to hold one man in a recumbent
position. The hearth was in ruins, the
window blown in, the door off its hinges, the
ceiling had partially fallen, and even the coloured
print of the Emperor, with which no post-house
or public office can ever dispense, hung in
wet fragments flapping against the mouldy
walls.</p>

<p>We tried to bale the water from the floor, but
it was labour wasted; it returned as fast as we
expelled it. Do what we would to block out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
wind, our barricades were useless against its fury,
owing to the many breaches it had already made.
We asked for wood or coal&mdash;the people had none.
We asked for food&mdash;they had none. We tried
the stables, thinking we might find shelter there.
Standing over their fetlocks in filthy slush, in an
atmosphere that would stifle an English horse in
three minutes, were the few wretched-looking
beasts whose lot it was to live and labour at
Tchaillee. And yet, in spite of adverse circumstances
such as these, in spite of short allowance
and no grooming, these hardy brutes, though
they look mere bags of bones, do more work
than our well-cared-for English horses, never
seem to suffer from coughs, colds, mud fever, or
any of the hundred and one ailments to which
an unnatural amount of coddling makes our
animals subject. There is this to be said for the
Russian, if he does not provide his beast with
good food and comfortable stabling, at least he
leaves him the coat that nature gave him.</p>

<p>After trying in vain to find a resting-place elsewhere,
Ivan and myself bribed the chief yemstchik
(who was also the postmaster) to let us share his
one-roomed hovel for the night. The man was a
Molochan, and lived with his parents and his children,
in a state of slovenly misery, in this one room.
The poor wife made the night hideous with a deep
racking cough that led one to hope that she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
not have to drag out a miserable existence at
Tchaillee much longer. The children were dirty,
listless skeletons, too lifeless even to quarrel or
play. The man seemed to do his work as driver in
the apathetic way in which a horse might work in a
mill, taking no interest in his task, and feeling no
desire to better his condition. The apathy of the
Russian moujik is the truly wonderful part of his
nature. Here was a man not more than thirty-five,
with half his days idle, with his wife and
children dying before his eyes for the want of a
little comfort, which a week’s work would have
given them, and yet he never seemed to dream of
mending the windows or roof, of draining the water
from the floor, or of doing anything to prevent the
stifling inroads of the smoke, any more than his
wife dreamt of cleaning or rendering comfortable
the inside of her dwelling. And yet these people
were Molochans, a religious sect, professing to lead
a pure life according to the light of their own reason,
disbelieving in fasting as practised by orthodox
Russians, and, as a rule, more sturdy, cleanly,
and useful than the average Russian moujik. The
Russian peasant settlers in the Caucasus struck me
everywhere as deteriorating rather than improving
with their change of country. Far into the
night my man and myself lay unable to sleep, tired
though we were, in this miserable den, passing the
time by knocking over with our kinjals as many as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
possible out of the droves of mice who made a
playground of our prostrate forms.</p>

<p>After leaving Tchaillee we got down again into
the plains, where the weather was much milder, and
travelling more interesting to a sportsman, since
wild-fowl began to abound by the roadside, owing
probably to the proximity of the Kûr. Between the
third and fourth station from Shemakha, the names
of which were apparently of such a crack-jaw nature
as to render all reproduction in English hopeless, we
crossed a tract of land covered with mud volcanoes,
some of which were as much as fifteen feet in
height. Here, too, we saw naphtha welling up from
the ground and running across the post-road in
large quantities. The yemstchik told me that the
whole country for miles round was full of it, but very
little was utilised, as the difficulties of transport
rendered the working of the oil unprofitable.
Should a line of rail ever be opened to Baku from
Tiflis, I should imagine that these naphtha springs
will become valuable property.</p>

<p>Whilst staying at the next station after the mud
volcanoes, I was lucky enough to witness a passage
of the strepita or lesser bustard (<i>otis tetrax</i>). These
magnificent birds were in millions all over the
steppe. The ground was grey with them; the air
full of their cries, the sky alive with the movement
of their wings. With them were a few small flocks
of another bird, which I thought I recognised as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
golden plover, but of this I am by no means sure.
So much struck was I by the strange sight which
this enormous passage presented, that I stayed the
greater part of the day to watch it; and when at
last I left, the almost inconceivable flood of winged
creatures was still rolling on over the steppe from
west to east in undiminished numbers. The Russian
powder which I bought at Tiflis had turned
out so badly, that at this time I had almost given
up using it for anything larger than teal, and even
then it was necessary to be at very close quarters
to bring the bird to bag, so miserably weak was it.
Thanks, however, to the dense masses in which the
bustards stood and flew, I was enabled to secure
sufficient to supply my man and myself with a
welcome change of diet, by the expenditure of only
two of my treasured ‘express’ cartridges. Judging
by what I killed, I should say the birds were only
just starting from their summer haunts in the
Crimea and Caucasus for their winter quarters in
the East. Had it not been so, they would hardly
have been as deliciously plump as we found them.</p>

<p>But whilst watching the bustards we had let
the day slip through our hands, and to our intense
disgust we found we could not reach Salian that
night; so we had to content ourselves with the last
post-station on the road thither, where we slept.
In the early morning I went down to the river,
glad to see the Kûr again, if it was only for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
sake of its abundance of clear water, offering a
bath without stint to the dirty wayfarer, and the
promise of caviare almost without cost to the hungry
epicure.</p>

<p>Thank heaven, a Russian yemstchik’s toilet does
not take long to make. A shake, a yawn, a
cigarette, and, if times are good, a glass of neat
vodka, and he is ready to face anything, from his
sweetheart to a north-easter. Would that his
horses’ gear was as speedily arranged as his own;
unluckily it is not. Still, in spite of the scores of
breakages in the harness of rotten rope and still
more rotten thong, our impatient desire to be off
was gratified at last, and with glowing visions of
at least a clean hut and heaps of good fish and ‘ikra’
at Salian, we bumped all breakfastless along our last
stage to the land of promise. All along our route
wild-fowl swarmed, and through the low covert we
saw numbers of foxes threading their way. All
the way from Adji Kabool, a station at the foot of
the hills in which Shemakha lies, and of which I
can find no trace in my map, any more than I can
of the large lake near it, to Salian and thence to
Lenkoran, the country is full of ponds, estuaries,
and lakelets, which teem with wild-fowl. I stopped
the cart once to kill some pochards for dinner,
and a couple of beautiful white egrets for preserving.</p>

<p>And now the river came in sight, a broad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
imposing stream, with the post-house on this side,
that is to say, on the eastern bank. To our disgust,
hungry as we were, we were detained at the
post-house for an hour, by the rascally Asiatic who
presided there, under the pretence that our papers
must be first examined by the authorities on the
other side before we were allowed to cross. So
well did the fellow impose on us, that though both
my man and myself were as puzzled as we were
angry, we submitted, until a Russian coming upon
the scene, informed us that the fellow was only
trying to extort black-mail from us for his supposed
services in getting our papers in order; and our
new acquaintance, having a fellow-feeling for his
countryman my servant, took the Asiatic by his
beard, spat in his face, and with many abusive
epithets ordered him to see to our immediate
transport to the other side, unless he wished to be
placed in charge of the police. Our courtesy and
civil speeches the brute had answered with all
possible rudeness, attributing our politeness, as all
these people do, to a sense of our own weakness;
but to the greater brutality of the Russian the
weaker nature of the Asiatic yielded at once, and in
a few minutes we were waving adieux to our timely
helper from the other side the Kûr.</p>

<p>Our first business was to inquire where the
hotel was, and our next where caviare might be
bought, resolving mentally to purchase sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
to feed us all the way to Lenkoran. Of course I
might have expected the answers to my questions,
after all I had seen of Russian promises and their
fulfilment. Of course there was no hotel. There
were but six Russian families of any kind in Salian,
all the rest were Tartars. Whatever you wanted
you might buy from Tartars in the open bazaar,
who would not serve you if they could help it; if
you wanted to eat, you might eat standing there
or in the doorway of the merchant who sold vodka.
There was no caviare at Salian to be had for love or
money. It was not the right season for fresh ‘ikra,’
and ‘pressed ikra’ (<i>i.e.</i> caviare) could not be bought
nearer than Bosghi Promysl, the great fishery,
fifteen miles off, where it cost rather more than it
does in the Crimea. Even had I been at Salian
at the right season, I could only have purchased
this luxury, for which it is famous, by stealth, as
the whole produce of the fishery is bought up by
merchants at a distance, to whom it is sent direct,
it being specially provided by contract that they
should have an entire monopoly. Thus, though
Salian and Bosghi Promysl are the places whence
the greater part of the caviare sold in Russia
comes, they are the two most difficult places at
which to buy it.</p>

<p>Standing moodily in the wine-merchant’s doorway,
munching a lump of dry bread, the meagre
realisation of all our dreams of luxury and rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
our wayworn looks arrested the attention of a
good-natured Russian custom-house officer, one of
the few Europeans in Salian. This good Samaritan,
when he heard the story of our blighted hopes,
took us home to his own house to dinner, and
whilst waiting for it a curious thing happened. A
messenger arrived from another Russian official,
of whom I had never heard, also asking me to
dine. Of course, I sent back the most polite
answer possible, pleading my previous engagement,
and promising to come and thank him for his
civility before I left Salian. To my astonishment,
the messenger came back in a few minutes to say
that I was not to heed Mr. So-and-so&mdash;he was
only a poor devil of a custom-house officer&mdash;but
was to come and dine at once with the great man,
his master. My host seemed by no means surprised
at the message, or even annoyed, though it
was delivered, to my intense chagrin, in his presence.
There was but one thing to say in answer
to this second message of my would-be host; and
having said it, I sat down to dine with my first
friend, meditating much on the manners and customs
of the East. But my astonishment increased
when, after dinner, my host entreated me to go
with him to his rival’s, that that rival might hear
from my own lips that it was no fault of my host
that I had dined at his house in preference to that
of the greater man. Of course I yielded, and both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
he and I met with a very favourable reception at
the hands of the great man, who produced in my
honour, on hearing that I was an Englishman,
two bottles labelled beer. These bottles of beer
had been the good man’s pride for many a day,
and I verily believe it gave him more pleasure to
be able to see a real Englishman drinking his
beer than it did that Englishman to humour his
whim.</p>

<p>In every house in Salian the Asiatic fever seemed
to rage; half the inmates of either house in which
I was entertained were down with it, and this, too,
at the time of year when it is least virulent.</p>

<p>There being no inducement to remain in the
place, we walked through it, and having found it
destitute of all objects of interest, ordered a fresh
team of horses to proceed on our journey to the
Caspian. For once the story that there were no
horses was found to be a true one, and, unable to
find lodging in the town, as we were unwilling to
burden either of our hosts with our presence, especially
since the fever had deranged both their households,
we made energetic endeavours to obtain some
conveyance to the next station, which was reported
weather-proof, and a capital station for wild-fowling.
Whilst thus engaged we came across a Tartar selling
foxskins, and were much struck by the enormous
quantity, all recently killed, which he had for sale.
They were skins of the common fox, shot in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
neighbourhood, and were being sold at from 30 to
50 copecks apiece.</p>

<p>Never had we such difficulty in procuring
horses as we had now. None of the Tartars or
other peasants would take us, late as it was, across
this first strip of the Mooghan desert to the next
post-station. It seemed that all the steppe was
covered by nomad Tartars, who descend every year
from the hills and winter in the Mooghan. These
men bear (probably with justice) an extremely
bad reputation, and, although we at last persuaded
a young Tartar of Salian to convey us in his ‘arba,’
it was only after we had spent all our persuasive
powers upon him, showing him how well armed
we were, and promising that we would keep ourselves
out of sight, in order not to excite the
cupidity of any of the wandering gentry we might
meet; in addition to which he stipulated that a
place should be provided for himself and ‘arba’
within the protection of the walls of the post-station
until next morning.</p>

<p>Under these conditions we stowed ourselves
away in the bottom of his cart, which resembled
nothing so much as a huge oblong wicker-basket
on solid wooden wheels, some eight feet high.
This edifice was drawn by one horse, through rather
than over eighteen versts of villanous road, the
consequence being that we proceeded at a foot’s
pace for the whole distance. Far and near in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
every direction were the fires of the Tartar encampments.
Several times, much to our driver’s
disgust, we had to pass within a few hundred
yards of their wretched tents, which consist of four
sticks stuck in the ground, and a piece of black felt
stretched over the top. Under this they rest, the
four sides open to every gust of wind, while a large
fire close by warms them where they lie, and with
its flickering flames lends additional wildness to the
scene, as well as to the grim figures passing and
repassing before it, and strangely magnifying the
group of animals tethered hard by. These nomads
must be more than mere gipsies, from the number
of horses and cattle which I saw in their encampments.
They are a great bore to the sportsman,
for, though the Mooghan is alive with antelopes
in the summer, these sensible little beasts leave it
as soon as the Tartar hordes make their appearance.</p>

<p>As we left Salian the evening was closing in
fast, and the whole sky was a vivid stormy crimson,
which, being caught by the endless level plain,
had a very grand effect. A vast flight of pelicans
in marching order, line upon line, came slowly
winging their way from the fishery at Bosghi
Promysl to their night’s rest in some reed-bed on
the Kûr. The solemn even flight of these great
birds, their countless numbers, great size, and
quaint grave aspect were in wondrous keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
with the scene, and formed with it a <i>tout-ensemble</i>
not easily forgotten. Once or twice <i>en route</i> a wild-looking
fellow on horseback rode up and inspected
us, but, though our driver’s nerves were much
upset by these visits of inspection, no evil came of
them, our visitors probably thinking one such
wretched horse as ours was hardly worth the
stealing.</p>

<p>From Salian to Lenkoran would have been an
excessively uninteresting drive had it not been for
the teeming bird-life on all sides. The nearer we
got to the Caspian, the more the fowl increased.
At one place we shot splendid Numidian cranes,
whose stately forms might frequently be seen. At
another flamingoes, white and rosy, tempted us
from our tarantasse. In the mist of early morning
an eagle, alit by the roadside, almost frightened
us by his apparently gigantic proportions; and
even when he flew away, unharmed and but little
alarmed by our bullets&mdash;when, too, we had made
all allowance for the exaggerating properties of
the mist&mdash;we could scarcely believe that he belonged
to any known species, so gigantic did he
appear.</p>

<p>In those parts of the journey where the post-road
ran through sand-hills near the sea, the noise
of the fowl was simply deafening. In the Crimea
the varieties of wild ducks are extremely numerous,
but here it seemed almost as if there were as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
many different species as there are ducks anywhere
else. The most striking, after the flamingoes,
swans, and pelicans, were perhaps the bright
red duck, called here ‘gagar,’ and the beautiful
mandarin duck, which I only saw once at close
quarters. But amongst the countless flights there
were scores of different plumages, to whose wearers
I could give no name; and I feel sure that any
ornithologist who is at the present moment looking
for some new ground over which to follow up his
favourite study, would find ample reward for the
journey in a visit to the swamps round Lenkoran
in the winter months.</p>

<p>Travelling by night over the steppe, we passed
a Tartar village at some little distance, from which
came an unwonted glow of red light, and cries as
of pandemonium let loose. On asking Ivan what
it meant, I was told that it was the Tartar
Bairam, or rather the preparation for it. Anxious
to see what was doing, I, contrary to my driver’s
advice, slipped out of the tarantasse and stole
unobserved upon the scene&mdash;a scene wilder than
the witches’ meeting in Macbeth. Among the
huts and hayricks on the wet steppe, a mob of
half naked Tartars had erected a post, and on this
post had fixed a monster firebrand. From this
the light glowed and flickered on the brown limbs
and wild faces of an excited band of dancers, who,
in perfect time, kept advancing and retreating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
around it, singing in time to their steps the while.
Now and again another band, which formed a
chorus to the principal performers, broke in with
a chant, of which I could only catch two constantly-repeated
words, seeming to my ears to be
best represented thus, ‘Shaksay, Maksay.’ The
dance, though extremely rude and simple, was
effective from the surroundings and the great
accuracy with which each performer executed his
part; and this was the more remarkable since every
male from four to eighty in the village seemed
to be taking part. The women only were idle
spectators.</p>

<p>After watching them for some time the dance
came to an end, and the people began to scatter, a
signal for me to get back to my cart before any one
caught me intruding. Ivan, my man, told me
that in another fortnight they would begin still
wilder rites, hacking and mutilating themselves
with knives, after the manner of the priests of
Baal.</p>

<p>The Russian peasants tell you that the Tartars
do this in memory of a certain Lutra, queen and
Amazon, erst of Erivan, whom Russian soldiers
slew. She, dying, bade the Tartars thus maltreat
themselves once a year in memory of her, the
which if they did, she on her part would in thirty
years’ time rise again, to lead and rule over them
in great glory. Many a thirty years has passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
since then, and Lutra the queen has not kept her
word: through which some of the Tartars have of
their own accord ceased to observe these rites;
others have yielded to the power of Russian law,
which forbids these savage orgies under penalty
of very heavy punishment; while still a few practise
their rites in the darkness of midnight and
in the desolate wild places of the steppeland.</p>

<p>For at least thirty versts of our journey the
road was impassable, owing to the overflow of the
river; and this necessitated a long circuit extremely
unwelcome to us. In the villages that we passed
through towards the end of our drive, the people
were for the most part Molochans, clean, hard-working
peasants compared to those around them,
but very objectionable from at least one point of
view, as nothing would induce them to cook our
game for us for fear of defiling themselves&mdash;fifty
per cent. of the birds we shot being unclean in
their eyes. These Molochans, near Lenkoran, are
probably some of the descendants of the 1,500 or
2,000 that the Emperor Nicholas drove out of
Russia into the Caucasus.</p>

<p>The country near Lenkoran is in places good
meadow land, covered even now with rich young
grass; here and there it has been broken up for
cultivation, and in such places the soil appears
extremely rich.</p>

<p>At last a long line of sordid huts announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
themselves as the suburbs of Lenkoran, and the
homes of another sect, which the Emperor Nicholas,
with greater reason perhaps, expelled from Russia.
These are the Skoptsi (eunuchs), or White Doves
as they prefer to call themselves. Besides mutilating
themselves, these people drink no strong
drink, and eat very little of anything beyond
bread and oil. The people of Lenkoran say they
live a quiet, harmless life. Those I saw of this
sect were big bloated men, with faces as devoid of
expression as the lives they lead.</p>

<p>Though Lenkoran was of course not the paradise
it had been represented to be at Tiflis, it was,
however, less disappointing than many of the places
I had seen. There were really a few Europeans in
the town; there was a fair bazaar where food
could be bought; there was a room attached to the
establishment which grandiloquently styles itself
the Lenkoran Club, in which we could sleep on a
wooden floor in comfort; there was a post-office,
and (although it took a long time to find him, and
when found, he had nothing but a single pair of
shears for apparatus) there was a barber. For the
rest Lenkoran is at this time of year a sea of mud;
in the summer it must be a cloud of dust. The
streets are in places paved, though badly; there
are no shops outside the bazaar, which is held in
an open space without the town, and where most
of the traders are Persian or Tartar; the houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
are ill-built; and from the dismal, sickly-coloured
sea, which lies motionless by the walls of the
town, comes an offensive odour which must be unbearable
in summer. The officials of the place are
almost all Armenian.</p>

<p>Soon after my arrival, I went down to the
bazaar to look for a gunsmith, and finding an old
Persian cross-legged in a booth hung with ancient
arms and dangerous-looking guns, submitted my
fowling-piece to him for repairs. The injury he
had to set right was a bad dent in one of the
barrels, got by a fall from the tarantasse on our
road here. The last I saw of him he had the end
of something like a poker down the muzzle and
was belabouring my luckless gun with a sledge-hammer.
I think this must have nearly roused
me; but it evidently did not quite, for my next
recollection is of waking suddenly in the booth
beside the old armourer, who had long ago finished
my gun’s repairs, and was now gravely amused at
Ivan’s face of surprise at the odd position in which,
after half a day’s search, he at last found me. Be
it said to the honour of that Persian, when I left
the bazaar my gun was fairly mended, and there
was nothing missing from my pocket.</p>

<p>During that first day at Lenkoran I had much
to do, especially as my man was told by the
employés of the local forester that we should not be
allowed to shoot without a licence. An interview<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
with the forester himself soon set this right, and
in his house I saw the skin of a recently killed
leopard, which gave me greater hope of success than
I had dared hitherto to indulge in. On the day
after my arrival I was lucky enough to make the
acquaintance of a German gentleman named Müller,
who from the moment he discovered my nationality
took me under his especial care. We met first at
the house of one of the sportsmen of Lenkoran,
who, having heard of my arrival, had arranged a
banquet in my honour. Here, after dinner, whilst
discussing the chance of seeing a tiger&mdash;a chance
which grew more and more remote the more I
pursued it&mdash;one of the guests proposed that I should
make a house of his in the neighbouring forest my
head centre during my stay. This hut he called
the ‘Shabby Shanty,’ and the chance of resting under
the roof of a house with an Irish name and an
English-speaking master, with capital sport all
round, was too good to be refused; so as usual I
decided on the spur of the moment to entrust myself
to my new friend’s care.</p>

<p>It is only fair to say that wherever I went in
Russia, I invariably met with ready hospitality, so
much so that my whole journey was little more
than a series of expeditions begun, if not finished,
under the auspices and at the suggestion of some
new-found friend.</p>

<p>Lenkoran is almost surrounded by marshes, in
which snipe and woodcock, with all manner of
long-legged, long-necked strangers to a British
eye, together with hundreds of the falcon tribe,
disport themselves daily. Here my man and myself
spent a day or two shooting specimens of the
birds least known to us; but on the third day we
took horse and rode to a larger lake, on which we
embarked with our friend the German, intending to
cross over to the woods which fringed the further
side, somewhere in the depths of which the ‘Shabby
Shanty’ lay. On this lake were simply myriads of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
water-hens. The whole surface seemed dark with
them, the reeds alive with their ceaseless cries.
The sale of these birds is quite a feature in the
street life of Lenkoran. The bazaar is full of their
carcasses; at every street corner you meet men
hawking them for sale; every other peasant you
see is carrying two or three home for the pot.</p>

<p>On the lake are many flat-bottomed boats in
which the fowlers pole themselves through the
mazy waterways in the reed-beds, until at a sudden
turn a closely packed bevy of water-hens offers
them a remunerative shot. So cheap are the birds
in the bazaar, that to kill them singly with the
gun would entail absolute loss on the gunner. But
besides these wild-fowlers, who are after all but
occasionally employed in their pursuit, there are the
regular enemies of the poor little fowl, men who
have decoys, and nets drawn across certain straits,
down which they drive the birds, until in diving to
escape they are caught by scores in the submerged
net. There are naturally quantities of other fowl
on these lakes, but the water-hen seems to thrive
and abound most, and is so much more easily
taken than the others that it is the staple food of a
large number of the inhabitants of Lenkoran.</p>

<p>On our voyage we overhauled one of the regular
fowlers, a Tartar, with whom we had a rather hot
dispute. As he drew up his net full of struggling
or already drowned birds, we were horrified to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
that instead of killing outright those which were
not yet dead, he took the trouble to break their
legs and wings, and so cast them a living, helpless
mass of pain and fear into the bottom of his boat,
there to live for hours in horrible anguish. We
explained to the fellow how much simpler for him,
and how much kinder to the birds it would be,
to wring their necks outright; but we might have
spared ourselves the trouble. The Tartar intellect
could not comprehend the beauty of mercy, and all
we could get was a grin and the assurance that if
he did not break their legs or wings they would
escape him; and as he might be out a day or two, if
he killed them at once they would not be fresh
when taken to market. It was no good arguing
any more; so merely insisting on putting all he had
so far taken out of their misery with our own
hands, we left him, feeling that were we to give
way to our own impulses he would have spent the
next few hours with four broken limbs in the
bottom of his own boat. The water-hens are sold
at about fivepence, wild duck at about sixpence a
brace.</p>

<p>On the far side of the lake a troop of villagers
were waiting to carry our baggage through the
swampy forest, where neither horse nor cart
could now conveniently travel, to our host’s log
hut.</p>

<p>The chief objects of cultivation here were rice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
and mulberry-trees; and though the wild boars
played the deuce with the rice-fields, the mulberry-trees
and their devourers the silk-worms throve
amazingly. Mr. Müller, our host, had not knocked
about in all the odd corners of the earth for
nothing, so that when we reached his Shanty,
though at a couple of dozen paces or so you might
meet with impenetrable jungle, we found it the
most comfortable well-built house we had seen
since we left Tiflis. In the night wild boars had
dug up the small patch of garden by the door; on
a little lawn not far off, a badger had turned up
all the turf in his nocturnal gambols; while right
and left as we approached snipe and cock went off
like crackers from under our feet.</p>

<p>During the first three days of our stay at
Eryvool, we did nothing but shoot cock and pheasant,
or, with a pack of fine dogs, the pride of Mr.
Müller’s heart, hunt the wild swine that abounded in
the thick places of the forest; while east and west,
and south and north, our messengers went forth
offering large rewards for tidings of any tiger or
leopard within three days’ march.</p>

<p>To those who have not seen the wild-fowl shooting
of the Caspian, any account of the swarms of
cock and snipe (chiefly jack) at Eryvool in the beginning
of the year 1879 would seem overdrawn.
We were sick of shooting before the three days
were over, though it took more than one day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
ceaseless firing to get used to the snap-shooting,
which is alone practicable in these dense coverts.
Wherever the forest was at all dry&mdash;and this was
for the most part in fairly open places&mdash;the rush and
glitter of a pheasant’s noisy wings broke the monotony
of cock-shooting. Once, as I snapped at
one of the ghost-like little birds flipping over the
top of the thick bush with silent wing, that had kept
me engaged all the morning, the bushes at my feet
were parted with a crash. With an indignant
snort, and tail curling crisply over his retreating
quarters, the black form of an old boar afforded an
excellent mark for my second barrel. Luckily for
me he did not charge, or a rent in my waistcoat
might have rewarded me for foolishly assaulting so
formidable a foe with No. 6.</p>

<p>Everywhere the forest was carpeted with flowers,
though the crocuses, of which my English correspondent
Mr. Maw was so anxious to obtain specimens,
had not unluckily shown their heads as yet.
The commonest flower of all was the crimson
cyclamen, and next to it its white congener.</p>

<p>Day by day the story was the same. Cock-shooting
in the morning, a run with the dogs in
the evening, a merry night with Mr. Müller in the
Shanty, but still no tidings of a feline foe. Let the
history of one day stand for that of many. An
hour’s plodding through mud and slush on a bright
spring day, with every now and then a snap-shot at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
a brown flash of light that glides through the trees
before us, has at last brought us to that thick covert
in which we expect to find the great wild boar.
All the dreamy spirit of the young year is abroad;
and as we lazily drag our legs over the clinging
morass, every briar that winds itself round us almost
tempts us to give in and roll over on the soft black
mud, rather than resist any longer the sleepy influence
of the season and the perpetual assaults of
bog and briar. The weight of our rifles has doubled;
never before were our coats so thick, never before did
an old mossy trunk look so irresistibly tempting;
and take it all in all, we begin to think a cigarette
and castle-building, with the buzz of the woodland
life in our ears and the languor of spring in our blood,
would be infinitely better than this ceaseless toil for
a boar who as little cares probably to be roused
from his deep dreams as we care to rouse him.</p>

<p>Luckily at this moment, when we were all but
yielding to the temptations of the sunshine, the
deep voice of old Shirka sounded a <i>réveillée</i>: in
a second dreaminess had gone, the briars ceased to
hold, and if the young wood did swing back and
nearly switch our eyes out or break the bridge of
that too prominent nose, we heeded it not. For
before us, with gruntings and with snortings loud
enough to wake the whole drowsy woodland, a
great black sow is crashing through the covert, the
sable imps, who call her mother, pressing close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
behind, while the deep voices of Shirka and his mates
urge them on to still more desperate endeavour.
Each gunner, who up till now has been but half
animate, plunges recklessly through the rending
thorns to gain some point at which to turn the
chase or make that shot which shall render him the
after-dinner hero of the day. And now from the deep
baying and the cessation of the crashing amongst
the scrub, we judge that Shirka and his friends have
collared the quarry in the thick thorn yonder; so
thick that the light can barely penetrate, and so
viciously tenacious and spiteful as to give the invading
sportsman an idea of personal malice. From
a point of vantage we at last get a glimpse of the
fray. There are seven small pigs, and on the flanks
of each a dog is hanging, while the great yellow
dog Shirka and another are struggling silently with
the old sow in the middle of a small pond of black
mud and water. But she is too strong for them: we
dare not, however, help with our rifles, and cannot
get to close quarters in time with our knives; so
one by one the little squeakers wriggle themselves
away, and the old mother and her litter, after
another rapid burst, get clean off, and leave us all
lamenting. Had the pigs been of larger growth the
dogs would in all probability have concentrated
their attentions more upon one object, and so our
chase might have had a happier issue.</p>

<p>As it was we pursued our way in crestfallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
silence, until Shirka makes a point at a small thorn-bush
by our side. ‘Nonsense, old dog, come away;
we can see through it.’ Hardly were the words
out of our mouth than with more activity than you
would give a pig credit for, a huge old boar springs
from the very heart of the thicket, and the brave
yellow Shirka plunges recklessly at him. The
veteran hound is one great record of a thousand
fights, his tawny hide seamed and knotted with the
marks of many a tusk, but he is as reckless now as
he was when a puppy; and dearly as his master
loves his old hound’s pluck, he would give a great
deal to see a little of that discretion mixed with it
which might save his favourite from an untimely
end. As the hound closes the boar turns, and in
the turning offers a fair mark for the rifle on the
other side of the thicket; so once more old Shirka is
saved from those gnashing ivory bayonets which he
has so often rashly challenged.</p>

<p>After this there is a lull. The hounds’ loud
voices have proclaimed to every living thing that
death is abroad in the forest, and boar and roe have
moved off to some deeper recess, where in shadowy
silence they can spend the spring noontide unmolested.
One bird the rifle’s reverberating voice has
not scared, and as the great eagle comes wheeling
over the forest path, he throws quite a shadow on
his enemies below. But the voice that stilled the
wild boar can still yours, too, poor forest king, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
though you come down but slowly, you must rest
awhile on that old gnarled oak before your pinions
are strong enough to bear you away again, to die
in peace. Yet though the blood drops slowly from
your beak, you cling fiercely to the tough old
oak with iron claws worthy of their perch, and
look in silent, wondering rage at the foe scarce
thirty feet beneath. Then with one supreme effort
you launch yourself on your last voyage: again
the leaden hail strikes upward under the now failing
pinions, and the great lord of air furls his sails and
with a dull thud comes down, eyes still unclosed,
talons still drawn back to strike, and the curved
beak eager for other blood than the red stream that
dyes it now. Peace be with you, brave bird; like
many another, when the shot had been fired, I
would have given the last rouble in my pocket not
to have fired it. Still as a hunter you lived, and, by
a just retribution, by a hunter’s hand you died.</p>

<p>After this the handsome form of the great black
woodpecker attracted our covetous eyes, and for
nearly a couple of hours his delusive whistle lured
Ivan and myself from tree to tree, always near us
yet never in sight. All things come to those who
wait, and at last his crimson crest was added to the
scalps of those already slain. During this day, too,
we were lucky enough to shoot that rare bird the
<i>picus St. John</i>, a woodpecker much resembling our
common spotted woodpecker. <i>A propos</i> of woodpeckers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
my friend Mr. Müller, who was a keen
observer of natural history, assured me that he
had frequently observed near his house during the
last two years an extremely small woodpecker, in
shape like all its congeners, in size if anything
slightly less than a sparrow, and in colour brilliant
emerald green. Being a zealous preserver of rare
birds, he had never attempted to molest the pair,
which he assured me built every year near his hut;
and I fear that it was my keenness to see the bird
and his suspicions of my evil intentions with
regard to them, which prevented his ever pointing
out to me these specimens of a woodpecker as
yet unknown I believe to British ornithologists.</p>

<p>Towards evening, tired with the chase, we
would light our cigarettes and make our way home
by some well-known track, shooting as we went
sufficient cock and pheasants to secure us against
the possibility of scarcity during the next few days.
Not uncommonly, as we drew near the house, the
dogs that for the last quarter of an hour had been
wearily following at our heels, with drooping tails,
stopping from time to time to lick a lacerated paw,
would suddenly erect their hackles, and fresh as
ever charge furiously into the home enclosure,
where, after the manner of more fashionable beings,
the wild swine family had been paying us a visit,
having first carefully ascertained that we were sure
not to be at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>The nights sped by blithely enough. The New
Year’s festivities, if not of any very formidable
pretensions at Eryvool, were at least lovingly protracted,
and every night our great-limbed German
friend might be seen mixing his loved lint wine
for our delectation and his own.</p>

<p>But one night the lint wine was not brewed, not
more than ten ‘papiroses’ were smoked, the talk was
no longer of Australian gold-diggings or American
prairies&mdash;for had not the natives brought tidings
of the game we had come so far to seek? At
some distance from our dwelling two nights before
a reiving tiger had struck down a Persian’s cow
at a little settlement on the edge of the forest;
there was the cow lying still, plain for all eyes to
see, and the tiger’s track clearly marked on the
sand-bank of the little rivulet hard by. The next
night saw an eager trio of sportsmen on the spot.
Round the copse where the tiger had been, and to
which we hoped he might return, Mr. Müller, Ivan
and myself posted ourselves, each perched in a
tree, and pledged solemnly to one another to
wait there in silence through the livelong night.
Their perches I did not see, but my own I have
cause to remember. A tall tree-stump, perhaps
twenty feet high, had been roughly hewn or broken
at the top, the ragged edges of which were terribly
apt to break, and pierce the too confiding being
who placed his weight upon them. Round this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
rough throne some small branches made a fairly
dense screen; and as some compensation for the
deficiencies of my seat, I discovered two deep
cavities, into which my long jack-boots fitted
admirably. Perched here, I heard the last soft
scrunch of my companions’ retreating tread; and
then taking a preliminary look at my watch, I
fairly settled down to my night’s vigil.</p>

<p>For a time, of course, we could expect nothing.
Our passage through the woods was sufficient to
have precluded all hope of seeing any game for
an hour to come. How still it all seemed.
Even the sea is a noisy babbler compared to the
depths of a forest at night. What a glorious
moon that was that gleamed down through the
network of creepers and wild vine above, throwing
long shadows on the grassy opening below. But
how slowly the moments pass! Is it possible I
have only been here a quarter of an hour? I
move restlessly, though silently, on my perch,
and then the intense cold which is numbing my
right leg calls for attention. On withdrawing
the suffering limb from its hiding-place the
mystery is solved&mdash;that comfortable hole, which
fitted the foot so excellently, is a natural well,
in which the offerings of many forest showers
have been carefully stored. No wonder that, as
the water soaked through during that frosty night,
the unlucky leg grew numb. The change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
posture necessitated by this discovery is decidedly
a change for the worse, and stronger and stronger
grows the conviction in my mind that a fair set-to
with Mr. Stripes for a quarter of an hour by broad
daylight would be far better than this silent night-watch
on a painfully acute tree-stump.</p>

<p>Gradually the inmates of the woods seem to
regain confidence. That sharp querulous bark
came from a jackal, who is ‘loafing around’ as the
Yankees say, just within the shadow of the
thicket opposite us. Then there is a whish, whish
of whirling wings, and we hear phantom flights of
duck come sweeping over the tree-tops close to us,
but invisible to our eyes in spite of the bright
moonlight. The silence is one moment intense;
then, before you have time to blink, the rush
of wings is upon you and past you, and the birds
are rattling and plopping down into the dark little
forest pools, in the soft mossy places, or, best of all,
amongst the young wheat of the luckless Persian.
What a merry chuckling they make as every fresh
flight comes in from its day-dreams and play on
the sea. Each batch of new comers takes at least
ten minutes to publish its budget of news and
arrange for its places at supper.</p>

<p>Again a sudden silence falls on them. Too-whoo-op!
too-whoo-op! Ah! you may well crouch
trembling under covert now. But as soon as the
shadow of the great night-fiend has passed on, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
ducks are as merry and noisy as ever. It is well
for them that they have no human minds, or the
horror of his presence would have stilled their
innocent merriment for the night. A more terrible
foe than the eagle-owl to all that are too weak to
resist him it is hard to conceive. The huge spread
of utterly silent wings, the lugubrious cry, the
enormous talons, sharper and more tenacious than
those of an eagle, and those great fierce eyes,
luminous with yellow fire, all contribute to make
a <i>tout-ensemble</i> of which a Hindoo devil might be
proud. Ghostlike, he glides by close to the earth,
a silent cloud in the moonlight, on wings that
never seem to stir. Woe to the crouching hare
whose ears, quick though they are, have told her
nothing of the approach of her mortal foe.</p>

<p>If the Tartars and moujiks of the steppes
where the eagle-owl is found are to be believed,
once the great bird seizes its prey, it has not itself
the power of relaxing its grip immediately.
Knowing this, and dreading lest the old grey
hare, gaining fresh strength from terror, should
in her mad career under thorn-bush and briar
tear her unwilling rider to fragments, the owl
clutches the ground or some other object with
one talon, while with the other she strikes the
prey. And now it becomes a tug of war for life
and death. If the owl’s muscles are strong
enough to hold the prey, well for the owl; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
if not, the moujiks tell strange stories of having
found half one of these grim birds, one talon still
clutching the ground, and the other, with the remainder
of the bird’s body, still firmly fixed to the
back of its escaped victim.</p>

<p>By-and-by, without even a rustle to announce
his approach, a large uncouth beast, like a small
bear with extremely bandy legs, is performing
strange gambols on the moonlit turf beneath
our hiding-place. After watching him long
enough to recognise in him a large badger, he
catches a glimpse probably of my rifle-barrels,
and noiselessly as he came, so noiselessly he melts
as it were out of the moonlight into the mysterious
shadows beyond. And so, with here and
there a glimpse of the private life of its denizens,
the long night in the forest passes away, growing
colder and colder till near the dawn.</p>

<p>At last there is a sound that startles the whole
neighbourhood, and the rustling of retreating feet
tells plainly that, though we saw them not, every
shadow had its tenant. A crashing of boughs,
and a firm, soft tread comes direct to my hiding-place;
and with straining eyes I watch, until
the outline of the great beast shall slowly emerge
from the shadow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>
<p>‘Hulloh! are you asleep up there? Come
down, and have a pull at my flask. No more
chance of a tiger to-night.’</p>

<p>And so the vigil ends. The great beast was
our friend M. The night had worn to morning,
and, slowly unbending my stiffened limbs, I let
myself down to <i>terra firma</i>, glad that the watch
was over, even though it ended in nothing better
than a nip of <i>eau-de-vie</i>.</p>

<p>Once more after this I watched the stars
brighten and fade in the cold grey of morning,
waiting alone for a tiger which never came;
then, fearful lest the wet season should set in,
and prevent our return to Tiflis, I bade adieu to
my friends, and on January 11 we started on the
return journey to Tiflis.</p>

<p>As soon as our cart came round the sky grew
gradually blacker, and with the first jingle of the
horses’ bells the patter of the first instalment of
the rainy season was mingled. From the time we
turned our faces to Tiflis until the moment when
Ivan left me in the baths of that city, waiting till
he should bring clean clothes in which to attire
me for my reappearance in a partially civilised
world, the weather went steadily from bad to worse,
and discomfort grew to actual misery.</p>

<p>I will not weary my readers with more than
a few glimpses of the return journey, of which the
first shall be the suburbs of Lenkoran. As we
approached them the road became so bad that our
horses could barely proceed at a walk; and, looking
ahead, we found the street a morass, bridged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
planks, through which we could by no means pass.
At the sides of the road, where the trottoirs had
been, women, with their scanty clothing tucked up
round their waists, were taking a mud bath and
walking exercise simultaneously, with this trifling
drawback, that, should they miss the trottoir, they
would probably disappear in the dark profound
beyond. This was, of course, an exceptionally bad
state of things, and we were told only happened
during the first day or two of the rainy season,
after which the streets got better, the filth accumulated
during the summer having been washed
away by the rains.</p>

<p>Wishing the ‘white doves’ a merry time of it,
we with great difficulty got our vehicle out of the
road on to the steppe; and here, though progress
was slow, it was at least better than it had
been. Two days spent in alternately being dragged
over morasses by our horses, and dragging them
and the cart out of the same, did not sweeten our
tempers, I presume; and it was perhaps for this
that a luckless Persian suffered at Adji Kabool.
Here in the early morning I was sitting huddled
up in my bourka amongst my luggage in the
extremely narrow space allotted to one of two
passengers in a Russian post-cart, when a ‘tchapar’
calmly pushed me to one side, and seated himself
comfortably beside me, without ceremony or apology.
On inquiring what he meant, and explaining that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the post-cart was hired by me, paid for by me, and
intended only to be tenanted by me and mine, the
intruder just deigned to tell me that he was a
‘tchapar,’ had a right to travel in any cart he chose,
and meant to travel in mine, whether I liked it or
not. Now, if this were true, it would not be an
additional attraction in Russian post-travelling;
but I fancy it was not: so I requested my would-be
fellow-traveller to make himself scarce at once,
and as he persisted in refusing, I hoisted him into the
mud by the wheels. As soon as he recovered an
upright position he clapped his old flint-lock rifle
to his shoulder, and putting the muzzle almost into
my face, deliberately pulled the trigger. Luckily
for me, in his fall all the powder which should
have formed the train to the charge had been spilt.
Moreover, his barrel was choked with good holding
clay, so that, taken all together, had the piece
not missed fire, the danger would have been greater
to him than to me. After this display of rage and
impotence, he turned to the people of the station,
and so worked upon them by his arguments that,
had I not taken the reins out of my yemstchik’s
hands and driven off, whether they would or not,
I am persuaded I should have been detained perhaps
for days at Adji Kabool, until I could communicate
with Tiflis or Lenkoran.</p>

<p>To travel by post-road in this part of the Caucasus,
and indeed all over Russia I believe, a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
should be as voluble, as loud-tongued, and as profane
as the proverbial Billingsgate fisherwoman or
a certain English M. F. H. I wot of. The only
kind of language a Russian servant, most of all a
Russian car-boy, can understand, is loud swearing.
From his childhood he has been accustomed to it.
His mother’s term of endearment to him as she
dandled him on her knees was probably ‘ach te
sukin sin’ (ah, you son of a she-dog), about equivalent
in English to ‘you little monkey.’ His master’s
name for him when good-tempered was ‘rosbolnik’
or ‘mashanik’ (thief or scoundrel), and he himself,
in addressing his horses, of which he is often
extremely fond, and to which he seldom applies the
lash, heaps on them epithets of the fondest endearment
and foulest abuse at one and the same time.</p>

<p>Our experiences of post-travel on our return to
Tiflis were of the very worst. At Aksu in mid-day
we were refused horses on the old plea that
there were none&mdash;an excuse utterly untrue, as a
glance at the interior of the stables assured us.
Reiterated demands were met by sulky refusals, and
on following the station-master to his own private
room I was reminded that the guests’ chamber was
my place, whither he would come if sent for. On
sending my man he found the door barred, and all
further interview denied. This little trick was more
than I could stand, so crossing the yard to the
fellow’s room I demanded the horses or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
complaint-book&mdash;a book in which travellers have a right
at all times to enter their grievances, which is kept
affixed by a seal to the table in the guest-room,
and which is the sole check upon the absolute
power of a station-master. To remove this or
to refuse to produce it, is the greatest crime the
station-master can commit, and would, if reported,
ensure his eviction from his post. But in this case
the man remained firm, being deep in a drinking
bout with his yemstchiks, and refused point blank
to produce either horses or book, or to let me in.
Feeling convinced that I had Russian law on my
side, and that the fellow, for his own sake, dare not
make any report, I kicked his door down, and taking
him by the arm brought him across to the guests’
room, where a couple of Armenian merchants in the
same plight as myself were kicking their heels and
cursing the cause of their needless delay. Having
got my enemy into the room, I had the doors shut,
showed him some letters of introduction I had
with me, and then telling him I knew to what he was
liable if I reported his refusal to produce the complaint-book,
I began to solemnly roll up the cuffs
of my Tscherkess costume, preparatory, as I informed
him, to administering to him severe corporal
punishment. The letters, my knowledge of Russian
post-road rules, and perhaps a certain air of meaning
what I said, had their effect, and in a minute the
other side of the Asiatic character was revealed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
insolent brutality giving way to disgusting, fawning
complaisance as if by magic. But I knew my man
too well to let him go, so that, having made him
order two troikas, one for ourselves and one for
the Armenians, I kept him a close prisoner until
the carts were actually at the door, when, with
many thanks from my fellow-travellers, I left Aksu
rejoicing.</p>

<p>These fellow-travellers claimed my help again
at the next station, alleging that they were co-religionists
of mine, being members of the Protestant
Church at Shemakha. It seems that forty
years ago their sect was founded at Shusha, my
informants said, by English missionaries, but the
names they gave them, ‘Larambe’ and ‘Fanther,’
sounded very un-English in my ears. Shortly after
the founding of the Protestant Church at Shusha,
the non-Protestant Armenians rose against their
newly-converted brethren, and induced the Czar to
have them expelled from Shusha, whence they
migrated to Shemakha, and there founded a
church, in which they now celebrate five services
a week, and number 500 of the richest inhabitants
of Shemakha amongst their congregation.</p>

<p>From Shemakha I sent a telegram on to Capt.
Lyall or Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;, I forget which, friends of
mine at Tiflis, to announce my return, and to prevent
my letters being sent on to Lenkoran. To
give some idea of the Russian telegraph service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
between Tiflis and the Caspian I may here mention
that, though I took many long days to get from
Shemakha to Tiflis, that telegram only arrived
simultaneously with me, whilst one sent from
Baku, three weeks before, arrived two days after
me; and though I travelled by the post-road,
and spent some days shooting <i>en route</i>, a letter
posted by me in Lenkoran just before I started
arrived long after me. So much for internal communication
on this side the Caucasus.</p>

<p>Day after day we plodded on, getting dirtier,
more starved and ill every day; travelling often
as much as sixteen hours in an open cart at a
stretch, the best travelling we ever accomplished
being 132 versts in that time. At Shemakha we
stopped to shoot antelopes, as much for the sake of
the pot as for the sport. A day’s rest and a good
dinner had become absolutely necessary; and though
the accommodation at Shemakha was so bad as to
make the rest impossible, we obtained the dinner.
Thus refreshed, we turned our faces on Friday
morning towards Tiflis, with a fixed resolve to
make no further stoppage in the thirty-six hours’
travelling which remained between ourselves and
the good things of that place.</p>

<p>For the last ten days my leading idea, my favourite
day-dream, the <i>ultima Thule</i> of my ambition, had
been a hot tub. To sit and boil in a hot bath of
sulphur water and get out a clean man into a clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
shirt, had been the one luxury in life to look forward
to; and now that it was within thirty-six
hours’ travel of me, I felt almost content as I curled
myself up in my cart, though snow and rain soaked
in through my ragged old clothes, through which
the wind cut almost to my backbone, and the
red mud splashed up, plastering eyes and mouth,
until we had passed beyond all semblance of
humanity. But there were to be more trials yet.
As we neared Akstapha the night had fallen, and,
weary with perpetual motion, I had cowered down
under my bourka in a vain endeavour to hide myself
from the cold and doze away the tedious hours.
The weather was abominably raw; an icy night
fog, blown by a cutting breeze that met us in the
teeth, wetted and chilled us to the bone. The hour
was between nine and ten, the moon had not yet
risen, and the night was starless. The road was
through the hills, and needless to say heavy and
hard to find in the darkness.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was roused by my man’s voice
calling me to get out at once. Peeping, half-asleep,
from under my rugs, I could see very little of anything
except that my man and the yemstchik had
both got down and the cart had stopped. ‘What
is the matter?’ I asked, feeling for my revolver, and
expecting the oft-promised highwaymen. ‘One of
the horses has fallen down,’ came the answer.
Cross at being disturbed for so little, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
wanting to get my stockinged feet wet in the mud, I
was curling myself up again with a sulky injunction
to the men to let the horse get up and be
hanged to him, when, to my horror, I felt the cart
tilting over in a way that threatened soon to reverse
our relative positions. In a moment I was wide
awake. The cart was already so far over that I
was obliged to jump the way it was falling, and my
next sensation was that of travelling through space,
such as one sometimes experiences in a dream.
This came to an end with a jerk, and my next
recollection is of being dug out of the mud at the
bottom of a considerable precipice from among the
<i>débris</i> of boxes, broken cart and horses, which had
accompanied me in my fall. By the greatest good
luck nothing had struck me, though the heavy
built cart had fallen so close as to pin down the
corner of my bourka, which was still on my
shoulders. Luckily, too, only one of the horses
was so far damaged as to be unable to proceed.
There was no village within reach. To walk on to
Akstapha in the then state of the roads and weather
would have been a wearisome trudge, even if we
could have persuaded the driver to leave his horses
and guide us, or ourselves to leave our belongings
in his charge, which we could not do.</p>

<p>Here, then, I had a splendid opportunity of
witnessing the really wonderful handiness of Russian
peasants in extremities. Thanks to our love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
of tobacco we had with us a box of brimstone
matches; grovelling about by the light of which
we retrieved all that was not utterly destroyed of
our luggage, and by means of old ropes, pocket-handkerchiefs,
and what not, so tied and spliced
together the broken harness, that after two hours’
work in that bitter winter night we managed to
extricate our cart and make yet another start for
Tiflis.</p>

<p>Beyond Akstapha, snow had evidently been
falling for some time past, and still continued to
fall until we reached Tiflis. Every verst showed
us deeper drifts, and at the last station from Tiflis
the drivers, in defiance of their master’s orders, refused
to get out of their warm corners to drive us
through the wintry night to the end of our journey.
After many threats and much persuasion one was
prevailed on to mount the box, and though we only
proceeded at a snail’s pace, we consoled ourselves
with the thought that every minute brought us
nearer our bourne. At last, when we had got
some three versts on the way, the horses were
brought to a standstill by their driver, who calmly
announced his intention of returning.</p>

<p>We were already half-frozen and irritable from
constant mishaps, so that his announcement was
not very cheerfully received, and every effort was
made to urge him on. Everything else failing, in
an evil moment Ivan persuaded me to use the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
common Russian argument, and, if he would not take
copecks, give him stick. He took a very fair
thumping as stolidly as an ox, and then utterly
nonplussed me by quietly handing me the reins,
and decamping into the darkness before I had time
to think.</p>

<p>Never in my life did I feel in a more awkward
predicament. The roads were deep with snow;
the night dark as pitch; the way unknown, over
a succession of hills down the sides of any of which
one false step might at any time hurl us. It would
never do to let the rascal go. As quickly as we
could Ivan and I dragged our team round and,
risking everything, galloped hard in the direction
of our runaway into the darkness behind, until, as
luck would have it, we nearly ran over him. Having
found him, all manner of bribes were devised,
every fearful threat conjured up that our imaginations
could furnish us with, and by the joint pressure
of hope of reward and fear of punishment we
at last got the sulky brute on to his seat, and at
about six in the morning drove into Tiflis.</p>

<p>True to my resolution, I made the cart set me
down at the baths; large subterranean places, in
which, in an extremely hot atmosphere, you may
bathe yourself in little baths of natural hot water,
strongly impregnated with sulphur, after which a
swarthy little Tartar, nearly naked, comes and,
kneeling on your chest, kneads your body with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
clenched hands, thumps and smacks you, pulls out
your different joints and replaces them, making your
fingers crack in a marvellous manner, and finally dries
and leaves you, feeling as if you had just had the
gloves on with the celebrated Professor Bat Mullins,
of Panton Street renown. Meanwhile, my servant
had taken away every rag I possessed, and in a
state of happy, cleanly nudity I sat awaiting that
greatest of boons to a weary wayfarer, a clean shirt
and an invitation to breakfast. Both arrived in
due time, and feeling once more that I was a few
steps removed from a Tartar beggar in appearance
as well as in feelings, I betook myself to an Englishman’s
house, vowing that, if I could help it, my
experiences of Russian post-travelling should never
go beyond my last stoppage at the sulphur baths.</p>

<p>The snowfall that now enveloped Tiflis was&mdash;so
the inhabitants told me&mdash;the heaviest they could
ever remember, and certainly never could Tiflis
have looked better than it did under the white pall
that hid all its foulness and lent such <i>éclat</i> to
whatever beauty it possesses. For me, too, the
snowfall had its advantages, in affording me an
opportunity of witnessing the pursuit of the antelope
on horseback as practised by the Tartars of
Kariâs. About two score well-mounted men, all
carrying rifles on their shoulders and a powerful
greyhound on their horse in front of the saddle,
started at an early hour for the steppe. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
found a herd of antelope, they proceeded to surround
and break it up, so that the quarry might separate.
Then each man chose his own prey, and for the
first part of the day followed it slowly from place
to place, never pressing it hard enough to make it
gallop any distance, yet never losing sight of it.
In this way travelling slowly over the unfrozen
snow, which ‘balled’ fearfully on its pointed feet, the
antelope became weary and harassed, the continual
slow pace tiring it far more than a smart gallop,
during which the snow would not have so much
chance of clinging to the flying feet. When the
poor little beast is sufficiently exhausted, the hunter
begins to close in, and even should the antelope
make a dash at the last it is ten to one it gets
headed by one of the hunter’s comrades. If, however,
it lets the Tartar get tolerably near, he drops
his hound from its place beside him for the first
time, and cheering him on with voice and example,
speedily runs down the already exhausted prey.</p>

<p>What puzzled me most was how the Tartars
induced their dogs to retain their equestrian position,
but I presume early training will teach the
dog as much as it does the man.</p>

<p>Whilst staying in Tiflis, I first heard the report of
the ‘black death’ or black small-pox, as the Russians
called the plague which was devastating Astrachan;
and fearing lest the story should be true that
it was spreading with rapid strides towards Russia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
or at least, that having come from the coasts of the
Caspian I should be put in quarantine, I determined
to make my way to the Black Sea, have one
more turn at the bears of Golovinsky, and then
get back to England before the fever became prevalent.
The Tiflis authorities made very little
difficulty, only taking my larger impedimenta
under their care, for the purpose of disinfecting
them before sending them on to England; so that
in another day or two I found myself once more at
Poti, with my faithful Ivan the Pole still with me.</p>

<p>We left Tiflis in a snow-shroud, which had, after
three days’ continual fall, frozen hard. We found
Poti in her spring dress, bright with violets and
cyclamen. Here we were detained two days
waiting for the steamer, and it may give some idea
of the place, when I say that the second day was
passed in hunting wild boar within a verst of our
hotel, which is the centre of the town; and so successfully,
that after plunging about in pools waist-deep
from dawn to mid-day, we carried back a fine
porker in triumph for our dinner. To help us in
the hunt we had some sixteen dogs and all the
able-bodied roughs of Poti, one of whom was armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
with the only specimen of an ancient blunderbuss
which I ever saw in actual use.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Poti must at no very
distant date have been one of the most favourite
habitats of the red-deer in the whole world. The
Mingrelian nobles were all staunch preservers of
game, and it was not until Russian greed of territory
had angered them, that they in revenge for
their wrongs, real or fancied, at the hands of their
somewhile ally, and to deprive that ally of his
favourite recreation, taken with or without their
consent, slew all the tall stags and graceful roebucks
in their land, whenever they could find
them, by foul means or fair. So it came to pass
that within the last ten years speculators have
bought cartloads of stags’ horns in the neighbouring
‘aouls’ for a few roubles the load, and even to
within the last three years it was still possible to
find in out-of-the-way places ladders used to reach
from the peasants’ ground-floor to his loft, composed
entirely of the branching glory of the forest
king. These things are now of the past, for the
Mingrel has discovered that stags’ horns are
marketable commodities: native middlemen have
ferreted out every pair of antlers in the province,
and established a regular trade in these and in
boars’ tusks, the majority of which articles were
sent to France to be made up into the hundred and
one knicknacks with which people adorn their libraries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Still the red-deer is by no means extinct
even now; in proof of which a gentleman working
at Poti, in the capacity of a civil engineer, told me
that a few months before my arrival he had been
invited to a large shooting party on the domains of
one of the neighbouring princes, on which occasion
not less than one hundred shots were fired at
red-deer during the day, although, owing to bad
shooting, very few were bagged.</p>

<p>From Poti we steamed to Sotcha, where I was
entertained by the agent of a German gentleman,
Mons. G., who stayed on the estate to protect it
throughout the late war. The danger to the property,
he informed me, was to be apprehended not
from the Turks but from the Russians, more especially
the Cossacks, against whose evil doings he
inveighed very bitterly. According to my authority,
wherever the Turks camped during the war,
private property was respected, and crops only
mulcted of as much as was necessary for the immediate
use of the troops. On the contrary, whereever
the Cossacks were, there too was wanton
destruction. Their only excuse if remonstrated
with was, ‘if we don’t do it the Turks will;’
and their officers refused to interfere. At a small
place in the immediate neighbourhood of Sotcha, for
example&mdash;Adler or Pol Salian&mdash;the Turks never
showed their noses, and yet the place is in ruins.
No compensation was granted to any of the sufferers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
from Cossack wantonness after the war by
the Government.</p>

<p>In Sotcha roses were in bloom when I arrived,
as well as strawberries; and my host told me that a
few days before my arrival he gathered half a
dozen ripe strawberries in his garden, which had
ripened out of doors, and this in the beginning of
February. Up to the time of which I write there
had been no frost at Sotcha. The chief produce of
the neighbouring gardens are grapes, of which
several varieties grow in great luxuriance on the
slopes just above the town&mdash;if town you can call the
few houses that surround the landing-place. But
if the Governor has not been misinformed and is
not too sanguine, Sotcha has a future, and may
at no distant date develop into a second Yalta. A
little table-land on the Poti side of the town has
already been laid out in sites for villas, to be
erected as summer residences for a number of old
military officers and their families. Better still, all
the sites are bought and paid for.</p>

<p>During the day which I lost at Sotcha waiting
for horses&mdash;for of course I lost one, as every impatient
traveller in this land of delays must be
invariably content to do&mdash;I heard again of the fearless
depredations of the lynx. During the night
the dogs of Sotcha&mdash;an extremely large and influential
body&mdash;were heard raising their voices in
a manner altogether unusual even with them; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
on inspection it was found that one large beast of
half sheep-dog, half setter breed, had been killed on
his chain by a lynx in the very middle of the town,
and partially eaten where he lay.</p>

<p>It has been said that there is very little game
in the Caucasus, and it was partly to correct that
mistake that this book was written. To show
how far from true the assertion is, Mons. G., with
whom I was staying at Sotcha, told me that before
the Tscherkesses left the Caucasus it was their
custom to make an annual expedition to the main
chain of the mountains along the Black Sea coast,
between, say, Anapa and Sukhoum, to obtain game
to salt for winter use. On one of these expeditions
my informant accompanied seven Circassians, a
few years before their evacuation of their native
wilds; and, during a fortnight, of which at least
a week was spent in coming and going, the eight
guns made an enormous, though by no means
unusually large bag, of which one single item
was forty-two chamois. There were also bears,
ibex, mouflon, and red-deer among the slain; and
though on this occasion they saw no aurochs,
Mons. G. assured me that he has seen some even
more recently than that.</p>

<p>On the second day at Sotcha, after a row with
the chief of the Cossacks, I managed to get horses
for my now formidable party, composed, with the
exception of myself and servant Ivan, of volunteers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
from the little town we were leaving. Some
of these volunteers, however, when they had it
finally explained to them that my little bell-tent
would really only hold two, and those two would
certainly be my friend Mr. Digby Lyall and myself,
made up their minds wisely to stay behind;
so that in the end the party only consisted of Mr.
L. and myself, my servant Ivan, a guide Niko, an
Imeritine&mdash;whose services, had I only been lucky
enough to obtain them on my first visit, would
have been invaluable&mdash;Ivan Kotoff, a Russian
moujik or peasant proprietor, and a Cossack with
the horses named Kalivan; while at Golovinsky
I added my old ally Stepan to the motley crew.
This was by far the largest party I had ever had
with me in the Caucasus; and by their aid, and
the aid of Stepan’s dogs, I expected to do great
things with the bears and boars of Golovinsky.</p>

<p>As soon, however, as we arrived at the place,
I found times had changed. Stepan had now
some work to do; and a gruff German telegraphist
was in possession of the hut in which I had formerly
taken shelter. However, by the help of his chief’s
letter of introduction to all telegraphists at the
various Caucasian stations, and thanks to my bell-tent,
I was soon fairly comfortable; but the next
morning revealed a very sad state of things. Where
in early autumn the bears’ tracks had been as thick
as leaves in Vallombrosa, there was not now a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
single broad footprint to be seen. All the family
of Bruin was either hybernating, or had moved off
to winter quarters in some more favoured spot.
Boars, however, were as plentiful as before, and the
first day’s sport gave me as fine a run with the
dogs after a wounded sow as I ever wish to have.
Crouching in a narrow track, which her kindred had
worn by frequent use through the dense covert of
blackberry bushes, I first saw her come pounding
down upon me in an opposite direction to that in
which I was going, and for a moment expected to
be run over by her if no worse. She saw me
luckily in time to pull up, and before she could
turn I gave her a bullet from my smoothbore,
which lodged somewhere near her spine. After
this the dogs got round her, and snapping and
snapped at she carried the whole pack headlong
down the precipitous wooded banks at a pace that
rendered human pursuit all but hopeless. For all
that, ten minutes break-neck work, with many a
crashing fall and all too rapid slide, brought me
to a point from which I caught a glimpse of the
old black beast brushing through a thicket, with
the dogs all over her; and hardly thinking of the
risk the pack ran, I took a snap-shot, and, as good
fortune would have it, turned her there and then
into pork.</p>

<p>Leaving her suspended in slings of wild-vine
tendrils beyond the reach of prowling wolves or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
marauding jackals, we kept along the edge of the
cliffs until we came to the fairest site for a sportsman’s
grave that the mind of man could conceive.
Here, on the very summit of a gracefully rounded
hill-top, was some three acres of greensward, almost
as fine and even as an English lawn. Up to its
very edge rose the dense forest-trees, through
and over the tops of which came glimpses of the
opalescent sea far down beneath. Here, in the morning,
the soft sea-breezes shook music out of the
rustling leaves, and in the evening the lengthening
shadows wove strange traceries on the grass.
Here the wild cherry-blossoms whitened the sward
in the spring-time, and in autumn the drooping
vines hung heavy clusters over the dead chiefs
tomb, in recognition of the tender care his ancestors
had bestowed upon the parent vine in days gone
by. What a difference between this breezy sunlit
hill-top and the terrible regions of brick and
mortar in which, after their narrow life in town,
the dead of London lie pent! One could almost
echo the sentiment of a veteran fox-hunter speaking
of his favourite grass country as compared to
another, ‘It would be better to be buried here than
live there.’</p>

<p>But in the midst of our day-dreaming a distraction
of a sufficiently startling nature called us
back to the present. In admiring the view we
had strolled from our first post of observation into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
a thicket of already budding yellow azaleas, from
which, as soon as we put foot in it, went forth the
most extraordinary noises, while we found ourselves
the centre of what appeared to be an enormous
black shell in the very act of exploding. A
second glance revealed the true nature of the black
objects that rushed frantically about on every side
of us. Unwittingly we had disturbed the rest, nay,
stepped right into the middle of the resting-place
of a big black sow and her litter of lively black
imps. Such a hunt after sucking pigs as followed
it would be difficult to describe. The dogs had
been sent home; so all the work had to be done by
ourselves; and from the small size of our prey and
the thickness of the covert, it was almost as easy
to catch as to shoot the succulent morsels. Most
of them escaped us, but we got enough to satisfy us;
so, tired and fairly content, we retraced our steps.</p>

<p>During the rest of our stay at Golovinsky we
had excellent sport with the wild swine, killing
one boar whose head an English naturalist declared
to be the largest he had ever seen in England.
But all boar and nothing else grew monotonous;
and after a week of this sport we struck our tents
and moved away to Yakorski, where, with hills
and woods all round us, a clear purling brook by
our side and the sea at our feet, we had good sport
till the weather changed. The only drawback was
that the tent which was meant to hold two had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
hold four, and owing to accidents and oversights,
our gear was of the most primitive nature. We
had one enormous caldron, in which we boiled our
pig-soup or our tea, as the case might be, and
from this, when its contents had somewhat cooled,
we, sitting in a circle round it, had to bale our
dinner with spoons constructed by some genius
from the bark of the willow. The process was
rather slower, owing to the incommodious shape
of the spoons, than lapping would have been, but
it was the only way. Amongst the many things
for which I have to be grateful to the Indo-European
Company is the one teacup which did
service for the four. This was neither more nor
less than a broken insulator which someone found,
with a piece of wood inserted in the hole at the
bottom to prevent leakage.</p>

<p>Living in this primitive fashion, we passed
several days, and enjoyed fair sport; the large
supply of meat which we had hung on the beech-tree
nearest our tent, attracting nightly bands of
jackals, who formed a cordon round us and kept
our dogs in a state of excitement the whole
twenty-four hours. Apart from the sport, my man
Niko was almost sufficient amusement in himself.
A wilder, less tutored fellow could not be found,
unless it were among savages; full of superstition
and stories of the chase, he always kept us
amused by the camp-fire. Amongst other things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
in which he firmly believed, as do most of his
people, was the ‘evil eye.’ He had a gun with
him, with which he told us that last year he had
wounded eighteen wild boars in succession without
bringing any to bag. Alarmed by this bad luck,
he went to the ‘wise man’ of his village, and by
him was reminded that the gun had been lent for
some time to a friend. This friend possessed an
‘evil eye.’ The only remedy was to secure a gun
belonging to his friend and spoil it, after which
his own gun would return to its natural good
behaviour. Niko took the ‘wise man’s’ advice, and
I presume paid him for it, surreptitiously spoilt
his friend’s gun, and from that time his shooting
improved rapidly, until he was again the Niko that
he used to be. Nothing I could say would convince
him of the folly of his story; and so much
did he believe in it that he even tried to persuade
me, when one of my guns went wrong through
an overcharge of powder, that the ‘evil eye’ had
been at work on my own weapons also.</p>

<p>But after a few days the clouds began to gather
blacker and blacker amongst the mountains, and
the rainy season, which we believed we had left
behind us by the Caspian, was upon us with a
rush. On Friday, February 15, the rain swept
over us in torrents; but, though the hills were all
hidden, and the creaking and groaning of the trees
almost frightened us, whilst the ground underfoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
became a morass, the bell-tent kept us fairly dry.
A temporary lull in the storm on Friday afternoon
tempted us out of our shelter; and, though the
woods were dripping and full of the music of a
hundred newborn rivulets, we essayed a farewell
hunt. The rain seemed to have aroused all the
dormant energies of the porcine race; and, at one
time, the noise they made amongst the fresh pools
as we came on them unawares was rather suggestive
of a morning in a cattle-market than one
spent in a mountain forest.</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe how wild swine swarm
in some parts of this coast, warrening the bushes
with their runs, and covering every marshy place
with their bathing-holes. Once we were fairly in
the forest the heavens opened their sluices again,
and before long our clothes were so sodden as to
be almost too heavy to carry, our boots parting
like wet blotting-paper; and when, weary and
drenched, we got back to camp, we found the
camp-fire submerged, and our bell-tent merely an
awning over a pond about a foot deep. The men
had neglected to entrench our position, and we
were fairly washed out. Luckily my aversion to
beetles had induced me to have my bed raised
some two feet from the ground, and, cowering on
this, we spent our time until Sunday morning. To
make a fire was impossible. There was not a dry
spot of earth within a square mile from our tent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
on which to lay it; and, even had we found a dry
spot, the blinding sheets of rain would have washed
it away as soon as laid. No fire meant very little
food, as none of us could eat raw wild swine’s
flesh, and we had very little else.</p>

<p>In the night a lot of wolves descended from
the mountains, and, attracted by the smell of our
beech-tree larder, came right into the camp, their
weird howlings, as they answered one another from
point to point, sounding very eerie in the storm.
Worse than that, Niko, who had been hunted by
wolves only a year before, within a mile or two of
this spot, got extremely nervous, and, worse still,
made the other men so. This, they said, was the
month in which wolves were most to be dreaded;
and, in a pack, with no fire to scare them, there
was no certainty that they might not invade our
tent during the night-watches.</p>

<p>To get back to the telegraphist’s hut was our
first idea; though, remembering its fragile nature,
I had my doubts whether there was much better
accommodation there than with us. This, however,
was rendered impossible. During the night
the mountain streams had risen, and a man who had
attempted to cross them in the evening was all but
drowned before he could get back to shore. At
the outset of the storm our Cossack, with the
horses, had deserted and left us to our fate, so that
there was nothing for it but to sit perched like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
owls on our little platform in the bell-tent, and
smoke away the time until the rain should cease.
My wretched men had no change of garments, so
that for the two days they had to sit and sleep in
their sodden clothes, and nothing but constant
application to their beloved vodka-bottle could
have saved the poor devils from fever. During
that last night the rage of the storm increased,
and, though our tent was in a wonderfully
sheltered place, it rocked and tugged at its moorings
in an alarming manner, whilst at last it ceased
to be waterproof, and our roof resembled nothing
so much as the rose of an immense watering-pot.
I think on Saturday night I must have gone to
sleep in spite of the streams from above and the
howling wolves outside, for in the morning I was
quite startled by a gleam of sunshine, and, roused,
I fancy, by the cessation of that perpetual pattering
of rain-drops which had lulled me to sleep.
As I moved my stiff limbs my clothes cracked with
the frost that had followed the rain, and our tent
itself was hard frozen, while outside the sun was
shining through a heavy snowstorm going on in
the second range of mountains behind and giving
but a very cheerless light to the miserable scene
around. Still, it was sunshine, and as such stirred
us to fresh endeavour, as nothing but sunshine
can stir a human being. By dint of drainage and
a few sticks we had kept moderately dry, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
managed to light a fire, although, except for the
few feet drained for the fire-place, there was still
no dry spot for the sole of a man’s foot. But
the crushing blow was to come. The rain had
done worse than wet us&mdash;it had washed down the
meat from our larder. The watchful wolves had
been rewarded for their patience, and we were left
breakfastless!</p>

<p>Very miserable wretches must we have appeared
when rescue came in the form of our returning
Cossack, late that afternoon, with some strong
horses to carry us safely through the rapidly-subsiding
torrents; and a bare-legged ride on bare-backed
Cossack horses, through streams which
wetted, and nipping north-easters that froze, our
half-starved bodies, was no pleasant finale to our
adventure. It was hardly to be wondered at that
when we did get to shelter my men told me they
had had enough sport for some time to come, and
meant to return to Duapsè as soon as possible. I
myself was no longer as keen as I had been, and
it was agreed that we should gradually make our
way to Duapsè, stopping for one last hunt, if only
to supply us with food, at the ruins of Heiman’s
Datch.</p>

<p>On February 19 we bade adieu to Golovinsky for
the last time, and since then its bay of wooded hills,
with the three tall blasted trees marking the spot
where my first bear fell, has been only a memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
to tempt me back. I should like to see it once
more, with its glorious cone-shaped tulip-tree in full
blossom; its jungles of rose-bushes, whose enormous
berries testified to the size of its perished
blooms, in the perfect beauty of summer; its great
forests of chestnut decked with spires of flowers;
and its long stretches of rhododendron and azalea
in their summer dress. It must indeed be lovely
then; and if the fever were only a possible and not
an absolutely certain consequence of the enjoyment
of its wonderful beauty, the pleasure would be worth
the risk.</p>

<p>But the wintry scene around us now was very
different. Above, the ragged clouds hung black
and threatening. Out at sea, the waves were for
some distance yellow with the influx of turbid
mountain torrents. Trees were hanging their
heavy dripping heads, broken and mutilated by
the three days’ storm. The sea, too, had been at
wild work during the night; and when the Black
Sea does wake to mischief it is a demon in its gusty
rage. The shore was strewn everywhere with drift-wood,
and over the carcass of an unhappy stranded
porpoise eagles were poising and soaring. Two of
my little party had a touch of the fever, and my
own throat was sore and swollen, so that the
tonsils seemed almost to choke me if I made any
unwonted exertion. It was evidently time to get
home. At Heiman’s Datch a forest fire had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
recently raged, and no game could be obtained for
the larder, so that we were almost without provisions.</p>

<p>Taking all these things into consideration, we
determined next morning to go straight on to
Duapsè, and give up any further hope of shooting.
Thus resolving, we built up a fire of drift-wood
under the old flooring, and lying round it dreamed
of home, dry clothes, and good dinners. Alas! that
good resolutions should always be formed too late.
When morning came, like a nightmare came upon
us that creaking and groaning of the trees we had
learned to know so well; that rush and babble of
waters that meant imprisonment for a starved-out
garrison. The tiny rill below the ruin, which the
day before had been nowhere ankle-deep, was now
boiling and foaming with a rage perfectly ludicrous
in such a baby river, and with a force that made it
almost unfordable. Not a moment was to be lost,
and in spite of the pitiless storm we determined to
push on foot along the shore to the next Cossack
station for horses before we were hopelessly
hemmed in by the mountain-streams.</p>

<p>It was already doubtful if we were not too late;
so leaving Ivan the Pole at the ruin to guard our
effects, my young friend L., Ivan Kotoff, and
myself, shouldered our small kits and trudged away
breakfastless over the wet shingle. It was heavy
going over the yielding beach, laden as we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
with bourkas and what not in that blinding rain,
and I was thankful when I saw my friend L.
safely at the end of it. Young as he was, I am
bound to say he made less trouble of it than our
burly Russian fisherman, whose red beard kept
wagging the whole time, and whose complaints
were the harshest sound even in that stormy scene.</p>

<p>At Selenik’s Datch we found the stream that
there empties itself into the sea swollen beyond recognition,
and divided into two, forming two small
cataracts, which hurtled along the big boulders in
a way that was a marvel to those who had only
seen it in its days of restful calm. Kotoff at once
pronounced it unfordable, and, being our guide, the
others unluckily would not listen to my arguments,
though at considerable risk I backed them by fording
the first stream, which was more than waist deep,
by myself. Naturally, though I was several times
all but washed off my feet, and to lose my footing
would in all probability have been to lose my life,
it would have been simple enough to have crossed
had we all linked ourselves one with the other,
and together breasted the torrent. But the Russians
were white-livered, and would not come, so
that I had to wade back again; and wet through,
disgusted and hungry, with my throat as I knew in
a dangerous state, I felt very like throwing up the
sponge.</p>

<p>After a weary tramp through the long wet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
covert, Kotoff found us a dismantled cowshed on
the Selenik property. Here we kindled a poor
fire, and tried in vain to dry the clothes which the
rain, driven through the broken roof, soaked as fast
as we dried them.</p>

<p>Our only supplies were three or four handsful
of rice, and we had a two days’ appetite to appease.
Hunting about in the cowshed, we found an old
paint-pot, and having cleansed it by burning,
patched its leaks with clay, and boiled in it the rice
and the few bunches of sorrel which we found
growing near, we made our first meal since noon of
the preceding day. What with the unpleasant taste
which the pot possessed and imparted to what was
put in it, together with the naturally disagreeable
flavour of the coarse sorrel, it was all we could do
to eat the mess when made, in spite of hunger, and
the root of horse-radish which we boiled with our
greens to give them a flavour. After this we brewed
our last pinch of tea in the same pot, and immediately
regretted the waste, as the horse-radish
flavour so far predominated that the addition of tea
to the water was useless.</p>

<p>In all our distress we had one consolation. I
had by great good luck saved a box of really first-rate
cigars which I picked up in Tiflis; and with
these to comfort us, young L. and myself huddled
together in a corner where there was more
wall and fewer crannies than elsewhere, and prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
to make a night of it, while the men lay
huddled in their bourkas. Nothing save the voices
of the storm and the spluttering of the fire, which
the rain soon extinguished, broke the sullen stillness
of the night.</p>

<p>It was not a cheerful end to my shooting expedition;
and again the truth of the Russian proverb,
which the men sometimes muttered, appeared
a possibility, ‘the chase is worse than slavery.’</p>

<p>During the night one of the men sang us some
wild Cossack songs, one of which I had often heard
the women crooning parts of before. Whether it
was that the wild forms and scenes that were round
me lent them a beauty the words do not really
possess, or whether there is in fact some charm in
this cradle-song of a warlike race, in some things
not unlike our borderers of two centuries ago, it
seemed at the time very impressive. I will therefore
try to help my readers to judge for themselves,
from a translation of Poushkin’s verses, which, if it
does not convey all the spirit of the original, is at
least a close transcript of the words and metre.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The words ‘bai-oosh-kie-baiou’ are merely the
refrain of the song, and as untranslatable as our
‘lullaby,’ so that I have left them in the original.</p>

<p>From scraps of songs which I have from time
to time heard crooned in the Crimea and elsewhere,
I should almost imagine that Poushkin’s words
here translated are only a remodelled and completed
form of some popular cradle-song in use in his time
among the Cossacks.</p>

<p>I am sadly afraid the Cossacks are no longer the
romantic personages they were when the poet wrote
of them. ‘Richard’s occupation’s gone’ may be said
of them. There is no one left for them to fight,
and their existence as Cossacks would lack an
object were it not for their duties as postmen.
They are as rough as ever, but not, I should say, as
ready with their weapons. Their love of cattle-lifting
can no longer be legitimately gratified, and
I fear I have cause to add that it has degenerated to
the level of petty pilfering.</p>

<p>Singing and smoking we passed the night,
trying in vain to still the voices of our unappeased
appetites with the dull narcotic which refused to
numb our pain. The rain had partially ceased at
dawn, and with that wonderful rapidity which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
characterises their fall as well as their rise, the mountain
torrents, which had been our gaolers the night
before, had now sunk to such a degree that arm in
arm we just managed to struggle through.</p>

<p>Once free from our prison, with the prospect of
breakfast and horses at the next plantation, even
Ivan pulled himself together, and before mid-day we
were all lying rolled up in borrowed rugs, while our
clothes were dried, and our appetites appeased by a
meal of black bread. This was all we could get,
for, like ourselves, Koylor’s Datch had been in a
state of siege, and if the rain continued was likely
to remain so.</p>

<p>These Russian plantations in the Caucasus are
terribly unremunerative I am told, in spite of the
richness of the soil. I think the reason is chiefly
that they are very much neglected by their owners,
no capital being expended on them; in addition to
which there is no market for their produce within
reach, and no reasonable roads anywhere. Moreover,
fever demoralises the workmen, and the wild
swine devastate the crops.</p>

<p>Whilst refreshing ourselves at Koylor’s Datch,
we sent for horses, intending to make all speed for
Duapsè; and to our great joy the weather cleared a
little in the afternoon, so that when the horses and
the Cossack guide arrived we were able to swing
ourselves into dry saddles and proceed forthwith.</p>

<p>Between our starting point that afternoon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
the Cossack station, at which we hoped to pass the
night, a mountain stream larger than most of its
fellows emptied itself into the sea, and it was of
this stream that we were most afraid. The Cossack
who brought the horses reported it extremely high,
but in one place still fordable, so that it was with
eyes fixed anxiously on the sky that we hurried on.
My young friend L. had become so far knocked up
that he thought it wiser to stay at Koylor’s Datch,
from whence I was glad to hear that he eventually
got safe back to Sotcha, and thence to Tiflis.</p>

<p>For the first verst or so of the sixteen we had to
travel before nightfall, the weather kept clear and
bright, after which it grew suddenly murky and
overcast. The sea, muddy and discoloured near the
shore by the unwonted access of turbid fresh water,
spread itself out in broad streaks of vivid green and
Oxford blue in the distance. The waves rose apace,
and came washing right under our horses’ feet till
they touched the cliff that walled us in beyond.
Thunder began to mutter, and the whole under-sky
seemed to grow into waving plumes of dark purple
smoke. Then the rain came again, with sheet
lightning, near thunder, and little drifts of snow,
which seemed strangely out of place with the vivid
lightning. By this time the cold had grown so
intense that I was glad to fasten my rapidly
stiffening bourka round my neck and bury myself
in its voluminous folds. Suddenly the snow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
the thunder ceased, and for ten minutes there was
a respite, the sky growing more wild and eerie every
moment. What with the fury of sky and sea, the
horses became so panic-stricken as to be almost
beyond our control. Then the sun, after being
long hidden, showed himself low down on the
waves&mdash;for it was already five o’clock, and owing
to the storm nearly as dark as night. In shining
out now he only added to the horrors of the scene
the most ghastly purple face ever sun put on. And
no wonder, for he was peering through a hailstorm,
which soon reached us, whitening the waves with
its volleys of ice-bullets as it advanced.</p>

<p>Never before or since have I seen such a hailstorm.
The stones gave us positive pain as they
struck our faces and hands, and were as large on
the average as the bullets of my ‘express.’ Meanwhile
the thunderstorm had commenced anew, and,
while the lightning flashed with extreme brilliancy
so near us as to be dangerous, the voice of
the thunder almost drowned all other sounds.
Alas! in the intervals between the thunderclaps
we now began to hear another voice&mdash;the voice of
gurgling, fighting waters, and of the heavy stones
and tree-trunks whirled along by them in their
fierce career seaward.</p>

<p>When at last the stream came in sight, its
appearance was no more inviting than its voice;
but from its great breadth for a mountain stream, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
judged it was not so deep as its turbid appearance
led one to believe. Deep or shallow, it had to be
crossed. The Cossack said he knew the ford, and
offered to lead the way; and, after all, its wild
foamings were little worse than the hailstorm
that raged around. So, when he plunged in,
leading the packhorse behind him, I followed
close on his heels, entirely trusting to his local
knowledge for a safe passage. Luckily for him,
the Cossack was only a featherweight, while the
horse he bestrode was one of the largest and most
powerful I had seen during my travels; so that,
though the packhorse with his burden was immediately
upset and washed away, the man, clinging
to his horse, which made a gallant swim for it,
got safe to shore a long way down stream. I
was less lucky than the Cossack, whose fate I had
not seen; for, while half blinded by a vivid flash of
lightning, my wretched little screw toppled over into
the deep water, and was immediately carried after its
comrade, leaving me to swim for my life in a stream
like a mill-race, with my long wet bourka round my
neck, hampering my limbs and drowning me with
its heavy folds, and a ten-pound ‘express’ rifle
on my shoulders. It was well for me then that
swimming had been one of my favourite forms of
athletic exercise in my boyhood, or I should
never have managed to extricate my hands from
the bourka and make a fight of it with the stream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
Something, a stone or some drift-wood I suppose,
gave me a severe blow on the kneecap in crossing,
but this I only discovered subsequently, and when
at last I struggled somewhere safe to shore amid
the shouts of my men, I think, as I stood spent
and dripping in the hailstorm after my icy bath, I
fully realised the pleasures of travelling in the
Caucasus in the rainy season.</p>

<p>To go for the Cossack who had led me into the
scrape by his ignorance of the ford, to deprive him
of his horse, and, having seen my men cross by
the true shallow higher up, to gallop madly for
the Cossack station, were my first acts on recovering
myself a little; and between my bath and the
station I never drew bridle until I tumbled off
breathless at the door, whence, regardless of questions,
I made my way to the room where a dozen
Cossacks lay loafing in every stage of dirt and
idleness. Casting all squeamish scruples to the
winds, I stripped off my icy clothes where I stood,
borrowed a shirt from one dirty rascal and an
unutterable sheepskin from another, got a wandering
telegraphist, who happened to be at the station,
to give me about half a pint of neat spirit and as
much hot tea as I could drink, and turned in with
my back against the stove, trusting to the heat
within and without to restore my circulation&mdash;which
the ride had failed to do&mdash;and so save me
from the consequences of my immersion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of the evening my men arrived,
having saved most of the baggage, which had got
loose from the unfortunate packhorse, and when I
woke in the morning I found myself quite a hero
for my swim, and, better than that, a hero with
some moderately clean dry clothes to get into. In
the night, nevertheless, the gallant Cossacks’
chivalry and respect had not prevented their
stealing my watch and what remained of my
sodden cigars. Having dried these in the oven,
they had converted them into fine-cut tobacco,
which, when I woke, had provided every loafer
amongst them with a little store of cigarettes.
But my throat warned me that it was no time to
make a trouble of trifles, and that it was imperatively
necessary to get back to Duapsè at once,
catch the boat thence on the morrow, and get to
Kertch in time for medical advice if I needed it.</p>

<p>In the night the sea had come up to the foot of
the cliffs, thus barring the usual road to Duapsè, and
obliging us to ride some forty versts, by precipitous
and rugged bridle-roads, over the cliffs, during
which ride the horses’ vile pace, the infernal machine
called a Tartar saddle, and the ruggedness of the
roads combined to inflict on my already aching
frame unspeakable tortures. Worse than all, when
the last jolt had been suffered, and the last writhing
submitted to in fording the stream that separated us
from Duapsè, we found that, owing to the bad state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
of the weather, the Odessa steamer would not touch
there for a week, so that for seven days we might
kick our heels and be miserable in that charming
watering-place.</p>

<p>That week was too dark an era in my travels
to say much about it. I prefer, if possible, to
remember the Caucasus without Duapsè. Despondency
took hold of my faithful Ivan, as soon as he
had got his pay: like a true Russian, he took to
drink, and all through my illness left me to my
fate, in a drunken peasant’s cottage, while he wept
and sang by turns in the only ‘duchan’ in the place.
Day by day my throat became worse. The telegraphists
were kind to me; but neither they nor
the doctor (veterinary, I believe he was) knew what
was the matter with me; and every night the steam
that rose from the damp mud floor of my room only
added to my illness.</p>

<p>Once the Governor came to see me; and as he,
too, was a doctor, gave me some advice; but I doubt
whether his prescriptions, had he left any, could
have been made up in his government. However,
he brightened half an hour for me with his chat,
and that, doubtless, did as much good as any medicine
would have done. He told me of some wolves
which had gone mad, and were keeping a couple of
villages in a state of panic by their attacks, having
already bitten a man and several cattle, all of which
had since died from hydrophobia. This madness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
of the wolves is not by any means unfrequent, I was
told, and, strangely enough, generally takes place
during the coldest part of the year. I had intended
to have gone to the villages in the morning to see
what I could do for the peasants with my ‘express,’
but was unluckily tempted into a wrestling match
with a celebrated native wrestler; and the exertion
of winning one fall out of three against him was
the last straw that broke the camel-like back of my
constitution. The fellow was a capital wrestler and
extremely strong; he had acquired some of his best
throws, oddly enough, in England; so that, though
he threw me handsomely twice, I could console
myself with the reflection that he had learnt to do
it in my own country.</p>

<p>That night there was a wedding in Duapsè, and
every one naturally got drunk; and whilst I was
tossing in high fever on my bed a score of drunken
moujiks in enormous boots were dancing and shouting
in the next room. Two nights this lasted; at
the end of the second, when I was very nearly
beyond any further enduring power, Providence
willed it that the steamer should arrive; and as the
doctor insisted that I had nothing more than a bad
sore-throat the matter with me, I was taken on
board and landed at Kertch, in a critical stage of a
violent attack of diphtheria.</p>

<p>So ended my shooting adventures in the Caucasus,
and I may well be thankful that in the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
of M. Bulberg, of the Russian telegraph service, I
found a kind friend and attentive nurse, as I did also
in my old friend the English Consul. After a fortnight’s
careful nursing at M. Bulberg’s rooms by a
clever German doctor&mdash;whose name I am ungrateful
enough to have forgotten, though I am not the
less grateful for his services&mdash;I tided over my illness.
As soon as I was pronounced in a safe state to
travel, both as regarded myself and others, I started
for England, still wearing some of the rough gear
in which I had travelled, and arrived at the station
of the town in which I dwelt such a deteriorated
specimen of the English race, that what with my
rags and my beard, the first people I met on alighting&mdash;who
were the ladies of my own family&mdash;cut
me dead, and for quite a couple of minutes refused
to recognise me.</p>
